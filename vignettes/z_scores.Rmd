```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(searchterms)
```
This package provides an easy-to use wrapper for a textual analysis of potential search terms for scientific publications including an analysis of MeSH-Terms following the methodolgy of Hausner, et al. (2011)

Step 1
Import a set of references, that serve as a testset of potentially relevant studies of the review as a risfile:

```{r import references, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
testset <- z_scores(testset.ris)
```

```{r show tables, include=TRUE,}

head(testset$freetext)
head(testset$MeSH)
head(testset$qualifier)
```



a more concise table with German column names:
```{r}
print_z_scores(testset, terms = "freetext")
```
