AB  - OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of studies reporting swallow-associated 
      outcomes in patients who received surgery for head and neck cancer (HNC), 
      informed by an anatomic and physiologic framework of pharyngeal phase of 
      swallowing (Pearson's dual-sling model). METHODS: PUBMED and Google Scholar 
      databases were searched for peer-reviewed papers published between 1990 and 2019 
      using relevant MeSH terms. Exclusion criteria were 1) discussions comparing 
      reconstruction techniques, 2) case-report/series (n < 10), 3) perspective 
      articles, 4) papers comparing objective instrumental methods of swallowing 
      evaluation, 5) animal/cadaver studies, 6) no instrumental or validated swallow 
      assessment tools used, 7) papers that discuss/include radiotherapy treatment, 8) 
      systematic reviews, 9) papers that discuss swallow training or rehabilitation 
      methods. Two investigators reviewed papers meeting inclusion/exclusions criteria. 
      Muscles resected, anatomic resection site, swallow outcomes, and patient 
      treatment variables were collected. RESULTS: A total of 115,020 peer-reviewed 
      papers were identified. 74 papers were relevant to this review, 18 met inclusion 
      and exclusion criteria, and none discussed surgical impact on the pharyngeal 
      phase of swallowing using Pearson's dual-sling model. Most papers discussed the 
      effect of tongue-base, supraglottic, or regional anatomic resection. 
      Post-surgical resection Follow-up times ranged from 1 to 13 months. 67% of 
      studies used objective instrumental swallow studies; 22% used patient reported 
      outcome measures. Follow up time since surgical resection, time to feeding tube 
      removal, feeding tube present/absent, aspiration severity were used to define 
      dysphagia endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: To date, no surgical HNC studies have used the 
      dual-sling mechanism to guide study design, and dysphagia assessment has been 
      inconsistent. To counsel patients on the effects of surgery on pharyngeal phase 
      of swallow function, specialists need physiologically grounded research that 
      correlates muscles resected with consistent measures of swallow function.
