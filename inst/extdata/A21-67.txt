AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24-week course of abatacept in the treatment of active lupus nephritis and to assess the potential of abatacept to induce "clinical tolerance," defined as sustained clinical quiescence of lupus nephritis after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. METHODS: Patients with active lupus nephritis (n = 134) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind phase II add-on trial in which they received either abatacept or placebo in conjunction with the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial regimen of low-dose cyclophosphamide (CYC) followed by azathioprine (AZA). The primary efficacy outcome was the frequency of complete response at week 24. Thereafter, patients who met either complete or partial response criteria continued blinded treatment through week 52. During this phase of the study, subjects in the abatacept treatment group in whom a complete response was achieved at week 24 discontinued immunosuppressive therapy other than prednisone (10 mg/day). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between groups with respect to the primary outcome or any of the secondary outcomes, including measures of safety. A complete response was achieved in 33% of the subjects in the treatment group and in 31% of the subjects in the control group at week 24. Fifty percent of the subjects in the treatment group who met complete response criteria and therefore discontinued immunosuppressive therapy at week 24 maintained their complete response status through week 52. CONCLUSION: The addition of abatacept to a regimen of CYC followed by AZA did not improve the outcome of lupus nephritis at either 24 or 52 weeks. No worrisome safety signals were encountered.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may offer advantages over intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) for the treatment of lupus nephritis, but these therapies have not been compared in an international randomized, controlled trial. Here, we report the comparison of MMF and IVC as induction treatment for active lupus nephritis in a multinational, two-phase (induction and maintenance) study. We randomly assigned 370 patients with classes III through V lupus nephritis to open-label MMF (target dosage 3 g/d) or IVC (0.5 to 1.0 g/m(2) in monthly pulses) in a 24-wk induction study. Both groups received prednisone, tapered from a maximum starting dosage of 60 mg/d. The primary end point was a prespecified decrease in urine protein/creatinine ratio and stabilization or improvement in serum creatinine. Secondary end points included complete renal remission, systemic disease activity and damage, and safety. Overall, we did not detect a significantly different response rate between the two groups: 104 (56.2%) of 185 patients responded to MMF compared with 98 (53.0%) of 185 to IVC. Secondary end points were also similar between treatment groups. There were nine deaths in the MMF group and five in the IVC group. We did not detect significant differences between the MMF and IVC groups with regard to rates of adverse events, serious adverse events, or infections. Although most patients in both treatment groups experienced clinical improvement, the study did not meet its primary objective of showing that MMF was superior to IVC as induction treatment for lupus nephritis.

AB  - Background/Purpose: IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is over-expressed in lupus nephritis(LN). This proof-of-concept study examined the efficacy and safety of sirukumab, an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody, in patients (pts) with active, ISN/RPS class III or class IV lupus nephritis (LN). Method(s): Pts were enrolled if they had class III or IV LN on renal biopsy within 14 mo of randomization, persistent proteinuria (>= 0.5 g/d) despite immunosuppression (MMF or AZA +/- corticosteroids), and stable reninangiotensin system blockade. Pts were randomized to IV sirukumab 10 mg/kg (n=21) or placebo (Pbo, n=4) q4wks through wk 24. Primary endpoint was % reduction from baseline in proteinuria (protein/creatinine (P/C) ratio in a 12hr urine collection) at wk 24; major secondary endpoints included the proportion of pts with: 1) >= 50% reduction of baseline proteinuria; 2) meaningful reduction in proteinuria; 3) no worsening of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) based on serum creatinine levels (defined as < 15% decrease from baseline rate); all at any time through wk 24, as well as 4)% change from baseline in Patient's and Physician's Global Assessments of Disease Activity over time. Result(s): Median time from biopsy collection to randomization was 116 days. 76% of pts (19/25) completed 2-wks of treatment. No median reduction in proteinuria at wk 24 (primary endpoint) was observed in the sirukumab group. In contrast, the Pbo group demonstrated median 43.3% increase in proteinuria(Table), largely driven by 1 Pbo-treated pt. Secondary endpoints indicated 20% (4/20) and 15% (3/20) of sirukumab-treated pts, vs 0% of Pbo-treated pts, demonstrated a >= 50% reduction or a meaningful reduction, respectively, in proteinuria at wk 24 (Table). In contrast, at wk 24, 10/18 (56%) of sirukumab-treated pts and 3/4 (75%) of Pbo-treated pts had no worsening in GFR (Table). Neither Physician nor Patient Global Assessment scores improved in either treatment group. Among the 12 sirukumab-treated pts positive for anti-dsDNA at baseline, there was a mean 62.3% reduction in anti-dsDNA at wk 24. Among 6 pts who discontinued study agent, 5 did so because of an adverse event(AE)(anaphylactic reaction, increased liver enzymes, neutropenia, pneumonia, and LN worsening). No deaths occurred. Approximately half (47.5%, 10/21) of sirukumab-treated pts had >= 1 serious AE, the majority of which were infections. No serious AE occurred with Pbo-treated pts, although 4/37 (10.8%) screen-failed pts had 1 or more SAEs during the 8 wk screening period. Conclusion(s): IL-6 inhibition with sirukumab in pts with active LN did not result in a median improvement in proteinuria, however approx 15-20% of treated pts did show a notable reduction in proteinuria. A high frequency of serious AE was observed in this population of immunosuppressed pts with refractory LN. (Table Presented).

AB  - Introduction: Long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate efficacy of induction therapy in proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). To date, no consensus exists whether azathioprine (AZA) combined with methyl-prednisolone (MP) might be an alternative for cyclophosphamide (CY). Aim(s): To analyze the 10-year follow-up data of CY versus AZA/MP in patients with proliferative LN. Patients and Methods: Between September 1995 and September 2001, 87 SLE patients with proliferative LN were included in the first Dutch LN Study. Patients were randomly assigned to either CY pulses (750 mg/m2, 13 pulses in 2 years) combined with oral prednisone (OP) (CY group; n=50) or AZA (2 mg/kg/day) combined with intravenous MP (3x3 pulses of 1000 mg) and OP (AZA/MP group; n=37). After 2 years, therapy was identical in both groups; AZA (2mg/kg/day) combined with OP. After 4 years, it was advised to taper the dosage of both drugs over a year. Result(s): After a median follow-up of 9.6 years (range 0.1-13.2), 11% of patients reached sustained doubling of serum creatinine (CY: 8%; AZA/MP: 16%), 22% had a renal relapse (CY: 10%; AZA/MP: 38%), 5% reached end-stage renal disease (ESRD; CY: 4%; AZA/MP: 5%), and 13% died (CY: 10%; AZA/MP: 16%). Relapses occurred significantly more often in the AZA/MP group (HR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.6.-12.4). No significant differences between treatment groups were found in the proportion of patients with sustained doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, and mortality, or in serum creatinine, proteinuria, and cyto-toxic treatment regimens at last follow-up. Conclusion(s): This open-label randomized controlled trial showed that CY is superior to AZA/MP in the prevention of renal relapses. The proportion of patients with sustained doubling of serum creatinine, ESRD, or mortality was relatively low and comparable between the two treatment groups after 10-year follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to analyse the long-term follow-up of a randomised controlled trial of induction treatment with azathioprine/methylprednisolone (AZA/MP) versus high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (ivCY) in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) and to evaluate the predictive value of clinical, laboratory and renal biopsy parameters regarding renal outcome. METHODS: 87 patients with biopsy-proven proliferative LN were treated with either AZA/MP (n=37) or ivCY (n=50), both with oral prednisone. After 2 years, renal biopsy was repeated, and all patients continued with AZA/oral prednisone. The primary study end point was sustained doubling of serum creatinine. Secondary end points included renal relapse, end-stage renal disease and mortality. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 9.6 years, no significant differences between AZA/MP versus ivCY groups were found in the proportion of patients with sustained doubling of serum creatinine (n=6 (16%) vs n=4 (8%); p=0.313), end-stage renal disease (n=2 (5%) vs n=2 (4%); p=1.000) or mortality (n=6 (16%) vs n=5 (10%); p=0.388). Renal relapses occurred more often in the AZA/MP group (n=14 (38%) vs n=5 (10%); p=0.002, HR: 4.5). Serum creatinine, proteinuria and immunosuppressive treatment regimens at the last follow-up were comparable. Clinical and laboratory parameters at baseline and after 2 years, and renal biopsy parameters (only) at baseline predicted renal outcome. CONCLUSION: Induction treatment with ivCY was superior to AZA/MP in preventing renal relapses, but other parameters for renal function did not differ. AZA/MP can therefore serve as an alternative in patients with proliferative LN who wish to avoid gonadal toxicity of CY. Several prognostic factors of long-term renal outcome were identified.

AB  - We evaluated renal function in 107 patients with active lupus nephritis who participated in long-term randomized therapeutic trials (median follow-up, seven years). For patients taking oral prednisone alone, the probability of renal failure began to increase substantially after five years of observation. Renal function was better preserved in patients who received various cytotoxic-drug therapies, but the difference was statistically significant only for intravenous cyclophosphamide plus low-dose prednisone as compared with high-dose prednisone alone (P = 0.027). The advantage of treatment with intravenous cyclophosphamide over oral prednisone alone was particularly apparent in the high-risk subgroup of patients who had chronic histologic changes on renal biopsy at study entry. Patients treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide have not experienced hemorrhagic cystitis, cancer, or a disproportionate number of major infections. We conclude that, as compared with high-dose oral prednisone alone, treatment of lupus glomerulonephritis with intravenous cyclophosphamide reduces the risk of end-stage renal failure with few serious complications.

AB  - The predictive value of laboratory results and renal histologic data was examined in 102 patients upon entry into prospective, randomized, therapeutic trials of lupus nephritis. Three clinical features at the time of entry into the study were individually associated with increased rates of renal failure: age less than 24 years, male gender, and an elevated serum creatinine level. Subjects with diffuse proliferative or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis were at a modest but significantly increased risk for the development of end-stage renal disease compared with patients with other classes of lupus nephritis. Semiquantitative scores of histologic features (specified by activity and chronicity indexes) identified subgroups of patients with comparatively high renal failure rates. To address the controversial issue of whether renal histologic data significantly improve the outcome predictions in patients with lupus nephritis, multivariate survival models were generated, permitting simultaneous consideration of multiple prognostic factors. Outcome predictions based on the strongest clinical predictors (age, sex, and serum creatinine level) were significantly enhanced by the addition of activity and chronicity indexes. Only age and chronicity index contributed significantly to the five-variable model and together constituted a two-variable model, the predictions of which were similar to observed outcomes. In the context of the highly significant prognostic indicators (age and chronicity index), immunosuppressive agents appeared to provide a slight therapeutic advantage over oral corticosteroids alone.

AB  - Treatment of class V+IV lupus nephritis remains unsatisfactory despite the progress made in the treatment of diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. In this prospective study, 40 patients with class V+IV lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to induction therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and steroids (multitarget therapy) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY). Patients were treated for 6 mo unless complete remission was not achieved, in which case treatment was extended to 9 mo. An intention-to-treat analysis revealed a higher rate of complete remission with multitarget therapy at both 6 and 9 mo (50 and 65%, respectively) than with IVCY (5 and 15%, respectively). At 6 mo, eight (40%) patients in each group experienced partial remission, and at 9 mo, six (30%) patients receiving multitarget therapy and eight (40%) patients receiving IVCY experienced partial remission. There were no deaths during this study. Most adverse events were less frequent in the multitarget therapy group. Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity was not observed, but three patients developed new-onset hypertension with multitarget therapy. In conclusion, multitarget therapy is superior to IVCY for inducing complete remission of class V+IV lupus nephritis and is well tolerated.

AB  - The prognosis of patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis is generally poor, and the majority of patients with this lesion develop progressive deterioration in renal function. Intravenous "pulses" of methylprednisolone have been advocated for the treatment of severe nephritis. In this study, 15 patients with biopsy-proven diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis were treated with oral high-dose prednisone therapy, initially 2 mg/kg/day. They were compared with seven patients with similar renal pathology treated with six daily pulses of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, not to exceed 1 gm/day), followed by prednisone orally, initially 2 mg/kg/day. There were no deaths in either group and the side effects of therapy were similar in the two groups. Pretreatment GFRs for the pulse and high-dose groups were similar. There was a more rapid improvement in GFR following pulse therapy, but the long-term effects on renal function for the two modes of therapy were the same.

AB  - Fourteen patients were enrolled in a placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trial of 8 weeks of treatment for active lupus nephritis. Seven patients received prednisone at a dose of 1 mg kg(minus sign1) day(minus sign1) plus misoprostol at a dose of 200 &mgr;g P.O. Q.I.D.; 7 patients received prednisone plus placebo. The patients included 12 females, 2 males; 3 African-Americans, 3 Asians, 5 Hispanics, and 3 Caucasians. There were no serious side effects associated with prednisone or misoprostol treatment during the 8-week study period. Laboratory measures obtained at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks included complete blood count (CBC), ESR, C reactive protein (CRP), serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, 24-h urine protein excretion, C3, C4, and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). Statistical analysis was conducted assessing change in measures over time in the entire study group by paired t-tests. The effect of treatment on change over time was examined by analysis of covariance. Log transformation of the variables was performed prior to statistical analysis. For the entire study group, the mean levels of ESR, CRP, 24-h protein excretion, C3, C4, and anti-dsDNA were improved at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. The mean ESR at baseline was 70 plus minus 8 compared to 42 plus minus 8 at 12 weeks (p < 0.01). The mean CRP at baseline was 0.6 plus minus 0.2 compared to 0.2 plus minus 0.1 at 12 weeks (p < 0.01). The 24-h protein excretion was 4367 plus minus 769 mg at baseline compared to 2512 plus minus 709 mg at 12 weeks (p = 0.02). The mean C3 at baseline was 40 plus minus 4 mg dl(minus sign1) compared to 60 plus minus 4 mg dl(minus sign1) at 12 weeks (p < 0.01). The mean C4 at baseline was 14 plus minus 1 mg dl(minus sign1) compared to 23 plus minus 2 mg dl(minus sign1) at 12 weeks (p < 0.01). The mean anti-dsDNA at baseline was 4268 plus minus 1780 compared to 316 plus minus 111 at 12 weeks (p < 0.001). The baseline serum creatinine (1.12 plus minus.15 mg dl(minus sign1)) and creatinine clearance (82 plus minus 15 ml min(minus sign1)) were not significantly changed at 12 weeks (1.10 plus minus 0.2 mg dl(minus sign1) and 80 plus minus 17 ml min(minus sign1), respectively). Comparing the misoprostol treatment group to the placebo group, there were no statistically significant differences for ESR, CRP, creatinine, creatinine clearance, 24-h protein excretion, C3, C4, or anti-dsDNA at any time points. However, comparing the misoprostol treatment group at 4 weeks to the placebo group, a more rapid decrease in anti-dsDNA (reduction of 3297 plus minus 2374) was observed in the misoprostol treatment group versus 304 plus minus 409 in the placebo group), as well as lower mean anti-dsDNA levels (464 plus minus 140) in the misoprostol treatment group versus 4118 plus minus 3834 in the placebo group). Also, the C3 and C4 levels at 12 weeks in the misoprostol treatment group (67 plus minus 5 and 27 plus minus 3 mg dl(minus sign1), respectively) were greater than levels in the placebo group (52 plus minus 4 and 19 plus minus 3 mg dl(minus sign1), respectively). The data demonstrate that oral prednisone is effective in reducing proteinuria and improving the biological markers of disease activity (i.e., ESR, CRP, C3, C4, and anti-dsDNA) following short-term treatment of active lupus nephritis. Additionally, the more rapid change in anti-dsDNA levels and superior normalization of complement levels in the treatment group, although not statistically significant, are consistent with a biologic effect of misoprostol on lymphocyte function and the production of a pathogenic autoantibodies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anti-interferon (IFN)-γ monoclonal antibody AMG 811 in subjects with SLE without or with lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: In this phase Ib, randomised, multiple-dose escalation study (NCT00818948), subjects without LN were randomised to subcutaneous AMG 811 (6, 20 or 60 mg) or placebo and subjects with LN were randomised to subcutaneous AMG 811 (20, 60 or 120 mg) or placebo every four weeks for three total doses. Outcomes included incidence of adverse events (AEs); pharmacokinetics; levels of serum proteins (CXCL-10, interleukin 18, monocyte chemotactic protein-1); changes in gene transcript profiles and clinical parameters (Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) scores, proteinuria, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies, C3 complement, C4 complement). RESULTS: Fifty-six subjects enrolled (28 SLE without LN; 28 with LN). Baseline mean SELENA-SLEDAI scores were 2.2 and 12.0 for SLE subjects without and with LN, respectively. Most subjects reported an AE; no meaningful imbalances were observed between AMG 811 and placebo. Pharmacokinetic profiles were similar and mostly dose-proportional in subjects without or with LN. AMG 811 treatment reduced CXCL-10 protein levels and blood-based RNA IFN-γ Blockade Signature compared with placebo. Reductions were less pronounced and not sustained in subjects with LN, even at the highest dose tested, compared with subjects without LN. No effect on SELENA-SLEDAI scores, proteinuria, C3 or C4 complement levels, or anti-dsDNA antibodies was observed. CONCLUSION: AMG 811 demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetics and acceptable safety profile but no evidence of clinical impact. IFN-γ-associated biomarkers decreased with AMG 811; effects were less pronounced and not sustained in LN subjects. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00818948; results.

AB  - Pulse cyclophosphamide is more effective than prednisone alone in preventing renal failure in lupus nephritis. We undertook a randomised, controlled trial to find out whether pulse methylprednisolone could equal pulse cyclophosphamide in preserving renal function in patients with lupus nephritis, and whether there was a difference between long and short courses of pulse cyclophosphamide in preventing exacerbations. 65 patients (60 female, 5 male; median [range] age 29 [10-48] years) with severe lupus nephritis were assigned randomly to monthly pulse methylprednisolone for 6 months (25 patients), monthly pulse cyclophosphamide for 6 months (20), or monthly cyclophosphamide for 6 months followed by quarterly pulse cyclophosphamide for 2 additional years (20). Patients treated with pulse methylprednisolone had a higher probability of doubling serum creatinine than those treated with long-course cyclophosphamide (p less than 0.04). Risk of doubling creatinine was not significantly different between short and long course cyclophosphamide. However, patients treated with short-course cyclophosphamide had a higher probability of exacerbations than those treated with long-course cyclophosphamide (p less than 0.01). An extended course of pulse cyclophosphamide is more effective than 6 months of pulse methylprednisolone in preserving renal function in patients with severe lupus nephritis. Addition of a quarterly maintenance regimen to monthly pulse cyclophosphamide reduces the rate of exacerbations.

AB  - From 1969 to 1975, 53 patients with lupus nephritis took part in randomized trials comparing prednisone, oral azathioprine plus low-dose prednisone, and oral cyclophosphamide plus low-dose prednisone. After a mean follow-up of 85 months, cyclophosphamide appears marginally superior to prednisone for maintaining renal function (p = 0.03) and preventing end-stage renal failure (p = 0.07). Chronic change shown by renal biopsy assessed by a chronicity index was found useful in predicting renal function outcomes and response to immunosuppressive therapy. Three of 21 patients with a low chronicity index and 9 of 10 patients with a high chronicity index doubled their serum creatinine (p less than 0.00003). The probability of renal functional deterioration was not different among the treatments studied. However, in 14 patients with an intermediate chronicity index, 1 of 11 patients treated with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide doubled the serum creatinine level whereas all 3 patients treated with prednisone have progressed to end-stage renal failure (p = 0.005). The study suggests that single-drug oral immunosuppressive treatment combined with prednisone is most beneficial in lupus patients with intermediate chronic change shown by renal biopsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is effective for the treatment of severe lupus nephritis but has serious adverse effects. Whether mycophenolate mofetil can be substituted for cyclophosphamide is not known. METHODS: In 42 patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis we compared the efficacy and side effects of a regimen of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil given for 12 months with those of a regimen of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide given for 6 months, followed by prednisolone and azathioprine for 6 months. Complete remission was defined as a value for urinary protein excretion that was less than 0.3 g per 24 hours, with normal urinary sediment, a normal serum albumin concentration, and values for serum creatinine and creatinine clearance that were no more than 15 percent above the base-line values. Partial remission was defined as a value for urinary protein excretion that was between 0.3 and 2.9 g per 24 hours, with a serum albumin concentration of at least 30 g per liter. RESULTS: Eighty-one percent of the 21 patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone (group 1) had a complete remission, and 14 percent had a partial remission, as compared with 76 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of the 21 patients treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone followed by azathioprine and prednisolone (group 2). The improvements in the degree of proteinuria and the serum albumin and creatinine concentrations were similar in the two groups. One patient in each group discontinued treatment because of side effects. Infections were noted in 19 percent of the patients in group 1 and in 33 percent of those in group 2 (P = 0.29). Other adverse effects occurred only in group 2; they included amenorrhea (in 23 percent of the patients), hair loss (19 percent), leukopenia (10 percent), and death (10 percent). The rates of relapse were 15 percent and 11 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, the combination of mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone is as effective as a regimen of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone followed by azathioprine and prednisolone but is less toxic.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and the sequential use of cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine (CTX-AZA) demonstrate similar short-term efficacy in the treatment of diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis (DPLN), but MMF is associated with less drug toxicity. Results from an extended long-term study, with median follow-up of 63 mo, that investigated the role of MMF as continuous induction-maintenance treatment for DPLN are presented. Thirty-three patients were randomized to receive MMF, and 31 were randomized to the CTX-AZA treatment arm, both in combination with prednisolone. More than 90% in each group responded favorably (complete or partial remission) to induction treatment. Serum creatinine in both groups remained stable and comparable over time. Creatinine clearance increased significantly in the MMF group, but the between-group difference was insignificant. Improvements in serology and proteinuria were comparable between the two groups. A total of 6.3% in the MMF group and 10.0% of CTX-AZA-treated patients showed doubling of baseline creatinine during follow-up (P = 0.667). Both the relapse-free survival and the hazard ratio for relapse were similar between MMF- and CTX-AZA-treated patients (11 and nine patients relapsed, respectively) and between those with MMF treatment for 12 or >/=24 mo. MMF treatment was associated with fewer infections and infections that required hospitalization (P = 0.013 and 0.014, respectively). Four patients in the CTX-AZA group but none in the MMF group reached the composite end point of end-stage renal failure or death (P = 0.062 by survival analysis). It is concluded that MMF and prednisolone constitute an effective continuous induction-maintenance treatment for DPLN in Chinese patients.

AB  - AIM: The optimal maintenance therapy for active diffuse lupus nephritis remains to be established. In this study, we explored the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus for maintaining remission of active lupus nephritis compared to that of azathioprine. METHODS: Seventy patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis who achieved remission were enrolled in nine nephrology centers in China from 2006 to 2008. Patients were randomized either to tacrolimus plus prednisone (n = 34) or azathioprine plus prednisone (n = 36) for six months. Tacrolimus was titrated to achieve a trough blood concentration of 4-6 ng/mL, and the dosage of azathioprine was 2 mg/kg/d. Prednisone was administered at a dose of 10 mg/d to both groups. The primary outcome was incidence of relapse. Response, clinical parameters and adverse effects were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: After six months of therapy, two of the azathioprine-treated patients developed renal relapse compared to none of the tacrolimus-treated patients (p = 0.49; odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI (0.98, 1.15)). Leucopenia (defined as < 2000 cells per cubic millimeter) was significantly more frequent in the azathioprine group than the tacrolimus group (47% vs. 9%, p < .001). CONCLUSION: In conjunction with prednisone, maintenance therapy with tacrolimus and azathioprine has a similar low rate of renal relapse, and the tacrolimus regimen has a more favorable safety profile, with less leucopenia. However, since our study lacked sufficient power, longer follow-up is needed to draw final conclusions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intravenous cyclophosphamide with prednisone is an effective treatment for lupus nephritis, but with significant toxicities. We compared the efficacy and safety of tacrolimus versus intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter noninferiority randomized controlled trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 81 patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis from 9 nephrology centers in China from 2006-2008. INTERVENTION: Prednisone and either tacrolimus (n = 42) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (n = 39) for 6 months. Tacrolimus was started at 0.05 mg/kg/d and titrated to achieve a trough blood concentration of 5-10 ng/mL. Intravenous cyclophosphamide was initiated at 750 mg/m² of body surface area, then adjusted to 500-1,000 mg/m² every 4 weeks for a total of 6 pulse treatments. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was complete remission (proteinuria with protein excretion <0.3 g/24 h, serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dL, normal urinary sediment, and normal or stable serum creatinine level) at 6 months. Response (complete or partial remission), clinical parameters, and adverse effects were secondary end points. RESULTS: After the 6-month induction therapy, the tacrolimus group achieved higher cumulative probabilities of complete remission and response (52.4% vs 38.5% and 90.5% vs 82.1%, respectively) than the intravenous cyclophosphamide group, but differences were not statistically significant (log-rank test, P = 0.2 and P = 0.7, respectively). Proteinuria [corrected] was significantly decreased in tacrolimus- versus intravenous cyclophosphamide-treated patients after the first month of treatment, even with adjustment for baseline proteinuria (protein excretion, 1.76 vs 2.40 g/d; P = 0.02 for the log-transformed analysis). [corrected] After treatment, serum creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rates were not significantly different between treatment groups. Adverse effects, such as leukopenia and gastrointestinal symptoms, were less frequent in the tacrolimus group. LIMITATIONS: Nonblinded, small sample size, and short duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with prednisone, induction therapy with tacrolimus is at least as efficacious as intravenous cyclophosphamide and prednisone in producing complete remission of lupus nephritis and has a more favorable safety profile.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The value of a complete remission in severe lupus nephritis is well known but little is known about the impact of a partial remission in this patient population. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of achieving a complete or partial remission in a well-defined group of patients with severe lupus nephritis. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: In this study, 86 patients with diffuse lupus glomerulonephritis were reviewed for assessment of the value of a partial remission (50% reduction in baseline proteinuria to < or =1.5 g/d and < or =25% increase in baseline creatinine) and complete remission (proteinuria < or =0.33 g/d and serum creatinine < or =1.4 mg/dl) on outcomes compared with patients who did not attain a remission. These well-characterized patients were entered into a prospective therapeutic trial conducted by the Collaborative Study Group and were followed for more than 10 yr. RESULTS: All biopsies showed diffuse lupus nephritis. A complete remission was attained in 37 (43%) patients, a partial remission in 21 (24%) patients, and no remission in 28 (32%) patients. Baseline clinical and serologic features were similar among the groups, but patients with a complete remission had a lower serum creatinine and chronicity index compared with patients with partial or no remission. The patient survival at 10 yr was 95% for complete remission, 76% for partial remission, and 46% for no remission. The renal survival at 10 yr was 94% for complete remission, 45% for partial remission, and 19% for no remission, and the patient survival without end-stage renal disease at 10 yr was 92% for complete remission, 43% for partial remission, and 13% for no remission. CONCLUSION: Even a partial remission in lupus nephritis is associated with a significantly better patient and renal survival compared with no remission.

AB  - Thirty-nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and diffuse proliferative nephritis were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of long-term plasma exchange therapy. All patients received conventional therapy, and in addition, 20 were exchanged with albumin or plasma. The 20 exchange patients did not show a better preservation in renal function. However, a significant difference in renal function was observed in the 16 exchange patients who were replaced with albumin. This finding was underscored by a two-way analysis of variance and covariance, which revealed that background variables favored a better prognosis for the nonexchanged patients.

AB  - Thirty-nine patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis have been enrolled in a multi-centre randomised controlled prospective study of chronic 4L plasma exchange therapy performed every three to four weeks. In the patients randomised to the pheresis (P) group and who received either albumin or plasma as replacement, there was a difference of 33 per cent better renal function at this time in the study. This difference did not achieve a significance with a p value of less than 0.05. However, the 30 patients randomised into the P group to receive albumin replacement did demonstrate a 50 per cent difference from the C group which was significant at a p value of less than 0.045. This also correlated with a statistically significant reduction in immune complex titres in the P versus the C groups. Chronic 4L plasma exchange with albumin replacement may be a useful therapeutic adjunct in patients with SLE and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.

AB  - Twelve patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and biopsy-proved diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis were randomly allocated to a control group (to continue receiving conventional therapy only) or to a plasmapheresis group (to receive conventional therapy along with one 4-I plasma exchange a month). The six patients treated with plasmapheresis had better preservation of renal function, reduced disease activity, fewer admissions to hospital and less need for steroid and immunosuppressive therapy than the six control patients. The patients treated with plasmapheresis also showed evidence of reduced immunologic activity and had no side effects attributable to the plasma exchange. These results suggest that monthly plasma exchange should be assessed in a controlled randomized trial as a possible therapeutic adjunct in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term therapy with cyclophosphamide enhances renal survival in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis; however, the beneficial effect of cyclophosphamide must be weighed against its considerable toxic effects. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with lupus nephritis (12 in World Health Organization class III, 46 in class IV, and 1 in class Vb) received induction therapy consisting of a maximum of seven monthly boluses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1.0 g per square meter of body-surface area) plus corticosteroids. Subsequently, the patients were randomly assigned to one of three maintenance therapies: quarterly intravenous injections of cyclophosphamide, oral azathioprine (1 to 3 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), or oral mycophenolate mofetil (500 to 3000 mg per day) for one to three years. The base-line characteristics of the three groups were similar, with the exception that the chronicity index was 1.9 points lower in the cyclophosphamide group than in the mycophenolate mofetil group (P=0.009). RESULTS: During maintenance therapy, five patients died (four in the cyclophosphamide group and one in the mycophenolate mofetil group), and chronic renal failure developed in five (three in the cyclophosphamide group and one each in the azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil groups). The 72-month event-free survival rate for the composite end point of death or chronic renal failure was higher in the mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine groups than in the cyclophosphamide group (P=0.05 and P=0.009, respectively). The rate of relapse-free survival was higher in the mycophenolate mofetil group than in the cyclophosphamide group (P=0.02). The incidence of hospitalization, amenorrhea, infections, nausea, and vomiting was significantly lower in the mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine groups than in the cyclophosphamide group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, short-term therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide followed by maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine appears to be more efficacious and safer than long-term therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide.

AB  - For the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis, long-term cyclophosphamide (CY) regimens are efficacious, however, at the expense of substantial toxicity. In the last decade, sequential regimens of short-term CY induction followed by either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine (AZA) maintenance have shown to be efficacious and safe reducing the long-term exposure to CY. In a maintenance study including predominantly Hispanics and African-Americans, the patients who received MMF and AZA maintenance had a higher cumulative probability of remaining free of the composite of death or chronic renal failure (CRF) compared to quarterly intravenous CY (IVCY) maintenance (89% in MMF, 80%, in AZA and 45% in IVCY). Likewise, MMF and AZA maintenance were associated with significantly lower incidence of severe infections (2% in each MMF or AZA, and 25% in IVCY), sustained amenorrhea (6% in MMF, 8% in AZA, and 32% in IVCY), and hospitalizations (one hospital-days per patient-year in each MMF or AZA, and 10 in IVCY). In a European induction study including predominantly Caucasians, patients who received any of two sequential regimens, low dose versus high dose IVCY induction both followed by AZA maintenance, had a high cumulative probability of remaining free of treatment failure (84% in low dose IVCY and 80% in high dose IVCY; treatment failure defined as a composite of free of corticosteroid resistant flare, nephrotic syndrome, doubling creatinine, and persistent elevated creatinine). Low dose IVCY and high dose IVCY induction were associated with low incidence of sustained amenorrhea (4% in each group) and severe infections (11% in low dose and 22% in high dose IVCY induction). Of interest, most of the severe infection episodes occurred while patients were receiving IVCY induction. Finally an Asian study demonstrated that patients with proliferative lupus nephritis could be effectively treated with short-term oral CY induction followed by AZA maintenance. The cumulative probability of complete remission was 76%. The relapse rate was only 11%. The incidence of permanent amenorrhea and infection were 8% and 33%, respectively. None of the Asian patients had an increase in serum creatinine level to double the baseline value. Maintenance therapies with MMF or AZA following short-term CY induction in a sequential regimen are efficacious and safe for the treatment of high-risk patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a need to determine which response measures in lupus nephritis trials are most predictive of good long-term renal function. We used data from the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial to evaluate the performance of proteinuria, serum creatinine (Cr), and urinary red blood cells (RBCs) as predictors of good long-term renal outcome. METHODS: Patients from the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial with proteinuria, serum Cr, and urinary RBC measurements at 3, 6, or 12 months and with a minimum of 7 years of followup were included (n = 76). We assessed the ability of these clinical biomarkers at 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization to predict good long-term renal outcome (defined as a serum Cr value ≤1.0 mg/dl) at 7 years. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated to assess parameter performance at these time points and to select the best cutoff for individual parameters. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the parameters alone and in combination. RESULTS: A proteinuria value of <0.8 gm/day at 12 months after randomization was the single best predictor of good long-term renal function (sensitivity 81% and specificity 78%). The addition of serum Cr to proteinuria as a composite predictor did not improve the performance of the outcome measure; addition of urinary RBCs as a predictor significantly decreased the sensitivity to 47%. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the level of proteinuria at 12 months is the individual best predictor of long-term renal outcome in patients with lupus nephritis. Inclusion of urinary RBCs as part of a composite outcome measure actually undermined the predictive value of the trial data. We therefore suggest that urinary RBCs should not be included as a component of clinical trial response criteria in lupus nephritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a need to identify clinical characteristics and/or biomarkers that can predict treatment outcome in lupus nephritis. To this end, we utilized data from the Aspreva Lupus Management Study to identify possible baseline and early predictors of renal response to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC). METHODS: Patients with class III-V lupus nephritis were randomized to MMF or IV CYC. We assessed predictors of renal response, including baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and histologic characteristics, as well as early clinical and laboratory data, obtained within the first 2 months of therapy. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for renal response were calculated for each putative predictor. RESULTS: Normalization of C3, C4, or both by week 8 was strongly predictive of renal response at week 24 (ORs 2.5, 2.6, and 2.9, respectively; P < 0.05). Reduction in proteinuria by ≥25% by week 8 was predictive of renal response at week 24 (OR 3.2, P < 0.05). Reduction in anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) by week 8 was not predictive of renal response. Only 3 baseline characteristics (C4 level, time since diagnosis of lupus nephritis, and estimated glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) were predictive of renal response; the remaining characteristics (age, age at lupus nephritis onset, time since diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, sex, histopathologic class, anti-dsDNA antibody level, C3 level, level of proteinuria, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, or hydroxychloroquine) were not. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that baseline C4 level, time since diagnosis of lupus nephritis, baseline estimated GFR, early normalization of complement, and reduction in proteinuria independently predict renal response to therapy at 6 months.

AB  - Thirty-eight patients with diffuse glomerulonephritis of systemic lupus erythematosus were randomly assigned to add cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or nothing to low-dose corticosteroid treatment and have been followed for a mean of 21/3 years thereafter. Of the 11 patients with unfavorable outcomes (8 deaths and 2 beginning hemodialyses), 2 occurred on cyclophosphamide, 4 on azathioprine, and 5 on prednisone only. Deaths due to infection occurred on the cytotoxics, while deaths ascribed to central nervous system lupus erythematosus occurred exclusively on prednisone only. Gradual deterioration of renal function was observed in all three groups, most frequently on prednisone only. Undesirable events, some due to drugs, were observed. At the time of reporting, the cytotoxic agents seemed to add marginally to the control of the disease; other treatment schedules should be evaluated.

AB  - Forty-one patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and glomerulonephritis were studied in a randomized drug trial. Thirteen patients received prednisone only (Group 1), 16 received oral cyclophosphamide and oral azathioprine (1 mg/kg body weight . d of each initially) (Group 2), and 12 were given boluses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1.0 g/m2 body surface area every 3 months) (Group 3). The mean observation period was 42 months (range 1 to 6.5 years). Renal function deteriorated in four of 12 patients in Group 1 and three of 27 patients in Groups 2 and 3 (p = 0.114). By life-table analysis, 86% of the entire group survived 5 years after entry to the study. Marked hypertension, fluctuating changes in serum creatinine, erratic changes in levels of antibody to DNA, reduced C3 levels, increasing proteinuria or sustained hematuria, and flares of extrarenal disease activity occurred more commonly in Group 1. Infectious complications were not commoner in Groups 2 and 3. We conclude that any marginal benefits produced by the programs tested cannot be shown in this class of patients without markedly increasing the sample size. Our current studies involve more vigorous treatment of patients with more acute disease and less treatment during prolonged periods of relatively good health.

AB  - We report a prospective randomized study of 39 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and progressive glomerulonephritis who were assigned to treatment groups that received either prednisone alone or prednisone and cyclophosphamide combined. They received treatment for 6 months and were then followed up for an additional 18 months. No difference in outcome was seen in the two groups at the end of 6 months. Among patients followed up for an average of 24 months, fewer individuals showed later renal progression among those treated with cyclophosphamide and prednisone than among the group treated with prednisone alone.

AB  - To evaluate the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide in the treatment of lupus nephritis, we designed a prospective study of patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. Twenty-six patients received prednisone (average dose, 40 mg per day) and 24 combined prednisone (average dose, 29 mg per day) and cyclophosphamide (average dose, 107 mg per day) for six months. Thereafter, all patients received maintenance doses of prednisone. Most of the patients improved (84 per cent) after six months of initial treatment with either program. Early progression of disease, ending mainly in end-stage renal disease, was equally frequent in the two treatment groups in patients with already advanced disease. In a four-year follow-up study there was a higher incidence (P approximately 0.04) and average rate (P approximately 0.02) of clinical recurrence of nephritis in the group initially given only steroid than in the group initially given both drugs. However, the proportion of patients alive after four years with stable or improved renal function was similar in the two treatment groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance therapy, often with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, is required to consolidate remission and prevent relapse after the initial control of lupus nephritis. METHODS: We carried out a 36-month, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 study comparing oral mycophenolate mofetil (2 g per day) and oral azathioprine (2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day), plus placebo in each group, in patients who met response criteria during a 6-month induction trial. The study group underwent repeat randomization in a 1:1 ratio. Up to 10 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent was permitted. The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure, which was defined as death, end-stage renal disease, doubling of the serum creatinine level, renal flare, or rescue therapy for lupus nephritis. Secondary assessments included the time to the individual components of treatment failure and adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment (116 to mycophenolate mofetil and 111 to azathioprine). Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine with respect to the primary end point, time to treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.77; P = 0.003), and with respect to time to renal flare and time to rescue therapy (hazard ratio, <1.00; P < 0.05). Observed rates of treatment failure were 16.4% (19 of 116 patients) in the mycophenolate mofetil group and 32.4% (36 of 111) in the azathioprine group. Adverse events, most commonly minor infections and gastrointestinal disorders, occurred in more than 95% of the patients in both groups (P = 0.68). Serious adverse events occurred in 33.3% of patients in the azathioprine group and in 23.5% of those in the mycophenolate mofetil group (P = 0.11), and the rate of withdrawal due to adverse events was higher with azathioprine than with mycophenolate mofetil (39.6% vs. 25.2%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mycophenolate mofetil was superior to azathioprine in maintaining a renal response to treatment and in preventing relapse in patients with lupus nephritis who had a response to induction therapy.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Voclosporin (VCS) is a novel CNI intended for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as lupus nephritis. VCS's unique structure allows for less pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic variability and a potentially improved safety profile compared with other CNIs. The AURA study enrolled 265 subjects in over 20 countries using low (23.7 mg BID) or high dose VCS (39.5 mg BID) in addition to MMF 2g/day and steroids in active lupus nephritis (LN). Method(s): Entry criteria: renal biopsy within 6 months (Class III/V LN, ISN/RPS); UPCR>=1.5 (III/IV) or >=2.0 mg/mg (V); serologic evidence of active LN; and eGFR >45ml/min. The steroid protocol was 20-25 mg (Day 1) with taper to 5 mg (Week 8), and 2.5 mg (Week 16-24). 24 week objectives included: Complete Remission (CR) defined as a urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) of <=0.5 mg/mg using first morning void with an eGFR >= 60 mL/min without a decrease of >=20%; time to CR, Partial Remission (PR: 50% reduction in proteinuria) and time to PR. Result(s): The groups were generally well-balanced for age, gender and race, with a trend to higher proteinuria and lower eGFR data in the low dose VCS arm. The trial met its primary endpoint with superior CR rates in the low dose arm (OR: 2.03, p=0.045). There was a statistically significant improvement in time to CR and time to PR in both treatment arms (P<.01). A mean reduction in serum creatinine was seen in both arms (0.2 mg/dL low, 0.1 high; p<.001). BP did not vary by group. Over 90% of subjects experienced at least one adverse event; the most common being infectious (56.2% low, 63.6% high and 50.0% control), GI disorders (41.6% low, 52.3% high and 36.4% control). More serious adverse events occurred in the voclosporin groups (25.8% low, 25.0% high, 15.8% control), and were consistent with those observed in LN patients. Most deaths occurred in the first 2 months and were: low dose (infection-3, ARDS-2, thrombotic-3, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary hemorrhage), high dose (infection, PE) and control (CVA). All were considered unrelated to drug exposure by the investigators. Conclusion(s): The AURA study is the first global LN study to meet its primary end point, Response rate was rapid; increasing CR in the VCS arms was seen by week 6. This study demonstrated the positive additive effects of VCS, despite the rigorous steroid taper (mean steroid dose 4 mg at Week 16). Adverse events were higher in the VCS treatment arms, consistent with increased immunosuppression. The overall mortality rate was similar to other recent LN trials (ALMS 3.8%, ALLURE 4.7%, BELONG 3.7%), with a higher mortality rate in the lowdose group. These promising data will be used to plan subsequent studies of voclosporin in LN.(Figure Presented).

AB  - The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of 3 different therapeutic protocols in the treatment of patients with WHO class IV lupus nephritis and normal renal function. We carried out a randomized prospective trial. The treatment programs consisted of a standard therapy regimen alone (protocol A), plus plasmapheresis (protocol B) or pulse methylprednisolone (protocol C), followed by a slow (protocols A and B) or fast (protocol C) prednisone tapering schedule. Statistical analysis was performed, using univariate survival analysis according to Kaplan Meier and Breslow's test to compare survival curves. Eighteen patients entered the study: 6 protocol A, 5 protocol B and 7 protocol C. No patients developed renal insufficiency. Moreover, no statistical differences in the probability of inducing partial or complete disease remission and in reducing 24-hour urinary protein excretion to < or = 2 g per day were observed among the groups. Protocols A and B were more effective in comparison with protocol C in decreasing 24-hour urinary protein excretion to < or = 0.5 g and < or = 0.2 g per day. In conclusion, a slow prednisone tapering schedule is more effective in reducing 24-hour urinary protein excretion to < or = 0.5 and < or = 0.2 g per day as compared with a fast prednisone tapering schedule, even if it is preceded by methylprednisolone pulse therapy.

AB  - Systemic Lupus Erythrematosus (SLE) is an inflammatory autoimmune disorder that may affect multiple organ systems. The clinical course is marked by spontaneous remission and relapses. Severity may vary from mild episodic disorder to a rapidly fulminant life threatening illness. Clinical manifestations of Lupus Nephritis (LN) are varied according to the renal pathologic lesions. Treatment of LN remains controversial. As a chronic disease with periods of remission and relapses, it is unclear whether relapses should be treated as the initial presentation of the disease. This prospective study was designed to compare between three different modalities of therapy for treating LN patients. The study includes all systemic lupus patients seen in Alexandria University Hospital since January 2004 for 6 months. Forty-three patients with SLE were presented to us by SLE, only 31 had LN and 22 were included in the study. The patients were classified randomly into 3 arms. All patients received steroid therapy plus from the beginning either Cyclophosphamide (CYP) [Group I, n=7], or Cyclosporine (CsA) [Group II, n=7], or Azathioprine (AZA) [Group III, n=8], Full history and examination were done. Laboratory investigations included routine and immunological studies of ANA, Anti-DNA, C3 and C4. Renal biopsy was done in all patients. After 6 months of follow up; Serum creatinine was stationary in CYP group from 2.2 +/- 1.1 to 2.1 +/- 1.7; while significantly decreased in CsA from 2.8+1.7 to 1.0 +/- 0.5 mg/dl. Moreover; while proteinuria decreased in CYP from 2.7 +/- 0.7 to 1.8 +/- 2.2; there was more pronounced decreased from 6.9 +/- 10.0 to 2.4 +/- 1.2 g/24 hr in CsA group despite very huge increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). 2 out 7 cases of CsA group; while 2 of 6 of CYP group did not show improvement. Moreover; 3 of 6 of CYP group and 1 of 6 of AZA group needed to be shifted to CsA group because of side effects and/or no response to CYP and showed good response. These patients were either class V or IV. However; only one case in this study with signs of acute CsA toxicity was reversed by monitoring the dose. In conclusion, CsA in this study proved to be superior over CYP in LN at least in the short term follow up; provided to be given with appropriate doses even if it is used in class IV, which was thought to be very responsive to CYP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may offer advantages over intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) for the treatment of lupus nephritis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of MMF compared with IVC in the induction therapy of proliferative lupus nephritis. METHODS: We randomly assigned 47 patients with newly diagnosed active proliferative lupus nephritis class III or IV to open-label oral MMF 2 g/day for 6 months or intravenous cyclophosphamide 0.5-1 g/m(2) monthly for 6 months in addition to corticosteroids. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, 14 of the 24 patients (58.33%) receiving MMF and 12 of the 23 patients receiving cyclophosphamide (52.17%) had remission (P = 0.48); complete remission occurred in 6 of the 24 patients (25%) and 5 of the 23 patients (21.74%), respectively (P = 0.53). Improvements in packed cell volume, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies titer (anti-dsDNA), serum complement, proteinuria, urinary activity, renal function, serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha concentration and the systemic lupus activity measure score were similar in both groups. Two patients assigned to MMF and another patient assigned to IVC developed end-stage renal failure with commencement of dialysis. Adverse events were similar. Major infections occurred in two patients in each group. There was no difference in gastrointestinal side effects, but more diarrhea occurred in those receiving MMF. CONCLUSION: In this 24-week trial, MMF or IVC combined with corticosteroids demonstrated equal efficacy in inducing remission of proliferative lupus nephritis.

AB  - AIMS: Neoral is a new microemulsion form of cyclosporin. Pharmacokinetic reports in children are scarce. Therefore, we performed a pharmacokinetic study between Cyclosporin A (CsA) capsules and Neoral in paediatric patients with lupus nephritis. METHODS: A single 5 mg kg(-1) dose orally of either CsA capsules or Neoral was given to 10 paediatric patients (serum creatinine < 1.5 mg dl(-1)). CsA whole blood levels were measured for 24 h post-dose by h.p.l.c. RESULTS: Neoral had a higher C(max) and AUC(C(max): 943 +/- 176 ng ml(-1); AUC: 4612 +/- 785 ng ml(-1) h) than those of the CsA capsules (C(max): 697 +/- 187 ng ml(-1); AUC: 3483 +/- 873 ng ml(-1) h; P < 0.05). There was no difference in t(max) and t(1/2,z) between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: CsA Neoral had improved absorption and bioavailability, which is similar to what is reported in adults. However, interpatient variability still existed. Careful drug monitoring and dose adjustment should be performed during treatment to avoid nephrotoxicity, especially in lupus nephritis.

AB  - Cyclosporin A (CsA) was introduced in recent years for the treatment of lupus nephritis in patients with steroid resistance or in those with severe corticosteroid toxicity. Our previous study on paediatric patients showed that Neoral (a new microemulsion formulation) had better bioavailability than CsA capsules. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of Neoral in children with lupus nephritis compared with conventional therapy, we performed an open randomized study on 40 children, ranging from 9 to 14 yr old, with class III-V lupus nephritis and heavy proteinuria. They were randomly assigned to either Neoral (5 mg/kg/day), administered q.12.h, or prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day) plus cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for 1 yr. Both groups showed a significant decrease in proteinuria (Neoral: 4.62 +/- 1.93 to 0.35 +/- 0.29 g/day, P < 0.05; prednisolone plus cyclophosphamide: 4.52 +/- 1.86 to 0.62 +/- 0.21 g/day, P < 0.01). The CH50 haemolytic assay titre decreased after 1 yr of Neoral treatment (26.5 +/- 0.9 to 21.4 +/- 2.2 U/ml, P < 0.05). Serum C3 and anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA antibody levels also fell with Neoral (C3: 86.2 +/- 6.8 to 76.3 +/- 4.5 mg/dl; anti-ds DNA antibodies: 14.1 +/- 3.2 to 8.2 +/- 1.4 IU/ml, P < 0.05). The Neoral group had a significant increase in growth rate over the prednisolone plus cyclophosphamide group (8.2 +/- 1.1 cm/yr vs 2.7 +/- 0.6 cm/yr, P < 0.01) with improvement of growth status. During the study period, patients tolerated Neoral well with no significant changes in renal function, liver function or lipid profile. Our study implies that Neoral appears to be effective in suppressing proteinuria. Neoral should be regarded as being adjunctive therapy, perhaps with a steroid-sparing effect, in paediatric lupus nephritis. However, its long-term use awaits further studies.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Abatacept (ABA), a selective T-cell costimulation modulator approved for rheumatoid arthritis, is being evaluated for lupus. Preclinical data in murine lupus and Phase II data in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pts with arthritis, serositis or discoid lesions1 supported the development of ABA in lupus nephritis (LN). Method(s): This was a 12-mth Phase II/III double-blind study in pts with active ISN/RPS Class III or IV LN, requiring: urinary protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) >=0.44 mg/mg (50 mg/mmoL); active urinary sediment (>5 red blood cells [RBC]/high power field [hpf] or >8 white blood cells/hpf or cylindruria); and renal biopsy within 3 mths (if biopsy 3-12 mths, abnormal C3, C4 or anti-dsDNA also required). All pts received mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; target dose 1.5-3.0 g/day dependent on race) and up to 60 mg/day prednisone or equivalent (with response-guided taper after 28 days). Pts were randomized to placebo (PBO) or IV ABA (either 3 mths of ABA 30 mg/kg followed by 9 mths of 10 mg/kg [30/10], or 12 mths of 10 mg/kg [10/10]). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to Complete Renal Response (CRR: GFR within 10% of pre-flare/screening value; UPCR <0.26 mg/mg [30 mg/mmol]; inactive urinary sediment) confirmed at 30 days after the first response, compared using a Cox proportional hazards model. Secondary endpoints included time to Renal Improvement (RI) and Mth 12 rates of CRR and RI (RI: >=50% UPCR reduction, GFR >=50% improved if screening 15-59, otherwise >=90% of screening; no active sediment). Exploratory endpoints included 1) Patient Response (PR: UPCR <0.5 mg/mg [56.5 mg/mmol] or >=50% UPCR improvement to <1.0 mg/mg [113 mg/mmol] if baseline <=3.0 mg/mg [339 mg/mmol] or to 3.0 mg/mg if baseline >3.0; RBCs within reference range (<5-8/hpf) or >=50% reduction; serum creatinine normal or <=25% above baseline) and 2) Renal Response (RR: serum creatinine <=25% above baseline; >=50% UPCR improvement to <1.0 mg/mg if baseline <=3.0 or to <3.0 mg/mg if baseline >3.0). Safety was assessed. Result(s): Of 298 treated pts, 228 (76.5%) completed Mth 12 (78.0, 74.7, and 76.8% in PBO, ABA 10/10, and ABA 30/10). Time to CRR did not differ between groups (p=0.549 and 0.422) for ABA 10/10 and 30/10 vs PBO) nor did time to RI. Efficacy at Mth 12 is shown (Table). A subset analysis of 122 nephrotic pts (baseline UPCR >3.0 mg/mg) found ~20-30% greater reduction in UPCR in pts randomized to ABA vs PBO from Mth 6, maintained to Mth 12. Safety is reported (Table). Cause of death appeared to be underlying disease for 5 pts and infection for 7. (Table presented) Conclusion(s): ABA, MMF and steroids exhibited a safety profile similar to MMF and steroids in pts with LN. Pre-specified efficacy endpoints did not demonstrate a benefit at 12 mths for ABA vs PBO. Among nephrotic pts, an exploratory analysis showed improvement in proteinuria with ABA, suggesting that additional exploration may be warranted to investigate potential biologic activity in this subset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) abatacept, a selective T cell costimulation modulator, versus placebo for the treatment of active class III or IV lupus nephritis, when used on a background of mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids. METHODS: This was a 12-month, randomized, phase II/III, multicenter, international, double-blind study. A total of 298 patients were treated in 1 of 3 IV treatment arms: placebo, abatacept at the standard weight-tiered dose (approximating 10 mg/kg), or abatacept at 30 mg/kg for 3 months, followed by the standard weight-tiered dose (abatacept 30/10). The primary end point, time to confirmed complete response, was a composite measure that required maintenance of glomerular filtration rate, minimal proteinuria, and inactive urinary sediment over the 52-week treatment period. RESULTS: There were no differences among treatment arms in the time to confirmed complete response or in the proportion of subjects with confirmed complete response following 52 weeks of treatment. Treatment with abatacept was associated with greater improvements from baseline in anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, C3, and C4 levels. Among 122 patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria, treatment with abatacept resulted in an ∼20-30% greater reduction in mean urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio compared with placebo. Abatacept was well tolerated; rates of deaths, serious adverse events, and serious infections were similar across treatment arms. Gastroenteritis and herpes zoster occurred more frequently with abatacept treatment. CONCLUSION: Although the primary end point was not met, abatacept showed evidence of biologic activity and was well tolerated in patients with active class III or IV lupus nephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with proliferative lupus nephritis are at risk of frequent relapses. Whether low- dose prednisone prevents relapses is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: We undertook a pilot RCT to determine the feasibility of a larger trial. DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Single center Canadian outpatient nephrology clinic. PATIENTS: Participants with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a history of class III or IV lupus nephritis that achieved at least partial remission and remained on prednisone were eligible. MEASUREMENTS: Feasibility: proportion of eligible patients randomized and adherence to tapering regimen. Clinical: occurrence of renal or major non-renal flare of SLE. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, two-parallel-group randomized controlled trial of prednisone 7.5 mg/day (continuation) compared to a matching placebo (withdrawal). RESULTS: Of nineteen eligible patients screened, 15 (79%) were recruited and randomized; 8 to prednisone continuation and seven to withdrawal. All participants adhered to the tapering protocol to their assigned withdrawal or low-dose maintenance target. Over 36 months, the primary outcome occurred in four (50%) patients in the continuation group (three renal and one major non-renal flare), compared with one patient (14%) in the withdrawal group (one renal flare). Three participants (38%) in the continuation group had minor flares, while no patients in the withdrawal group did. LIMITATIONS: This pilot RCT was small and not designed to assess the efficacy or safety of maintenance with low-dose prednisone. CONCLUSIONS: The high proportion of eligible patients recruited, and success of protocol adherence suggest a large trial of prednisone maintenance therapy compared to withdrawal is feasible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN31327267.

AB  - A 1-year double-blind crossover study comparing prednisone and azathioprine to prednisone plus low-dose azathioprine and cyclophosphamide was carried out in 14 patients with diffuse lupus nephritis. Low-dose triple therapy had no apparent therapeutic advantage over prednisone plus azathioprine. Cyclophosphamide-induced ovarian failure and hematuria were not avoided by its use in low dose.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since anecdotal series and small, prospective, controlled trials suggest that mycophenolate mofetil may be effective for treating lupus nephritis, larger trials are desirable. METHODS: We conducted a 24-week randomized, open-label, noninferiority trial comparing oral mycophenolate mofetil (initial dose, 1000 mg per day, increased to 3000 mg per day) with monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5 g per square meter of body-surface area, increased to 1.0 g per square meter) as induction therapy for active lupus nephritis. A change to the alternative regimen was allowed at 12 weeks in patients who did not have an early response. The study protocol specified adjunctive care and the use and tapering of corticosteroids. The primary end point was complete remission at 24 weeks (normalization of abnormal renal measurements and maintenance of baseline normal measurements). A secondary end point was partial remission at 24 weeks. RESULTS: Of 140 patients recruited, 71 were randomly assigned to receive mycophenolate mofetil and 69 were randomly assigned to receive cyclophosphamide. At 12 weeks, 56 patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil and 42 receiving cyclophosphamide had satisfactory early responses. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 16 of the 71 patients (22.5 percent) receiving mycophenolate mofetil and 4 of the 69 patients receiving cyclophosphamide (5.8 percent) had complete remission, for an absolute difference of 16.7 percentage points (95 percent confidence interval, 5.6 to 27.9 percentage points; P=0.005), meeting the prespecified criteria for noninferiority and demonstrating the superiority of mycophenolate mofetil to cyclophosphamide. Partial remission occurred in 21 of the 71 patients (29.6 percent) and 17 of the 69 patients (24.6 percent), respectively (P=0.51). Three patients assigned to cyclophosphamide died, two during protocol therapy. Fewer severe infections and hospitalizations but more diarrhea occurred among those receiving mycophenolate. CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-week trial, mycophenolate mofetil was more effective than intravenous cyclophosphamide in inducing remission of lupus nephritis and had a more favorable safety profile.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Atacicept is a soluble, fully human, recombinant fusion protein that inhibits B cell-stimulating factors APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) and BLyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator). The APRIL- LN study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atacicept in patients with active lupus nephritis (LN), receiving newly initiated corticosteroids (CS) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III, 52-week study. At screening (Day -14), patients initiated high-dose CS (the lesser of 0.8 mg/kg/day or 60 mg/day prednisone) and MMF (1 g daily, increased by 1 g/day each week to 3 g daily). From Day 1, atacicept (150 mg, subcutaneously, twice weekly for 4 weeks, then weekly) was initiated with MMF along with a tapered dose of CS. RESULTS: The trial was terminated after the enrollment of six patients, due to an unexpected decline in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the occurrence of serious infections. Efficacy was thus not evaluated. By Day 1, serum IgG levels had declined substantially in patients then randomized to atacicept (n = 4) compared with placebo (n = 2). Patients receiving atacicept also had more severe proteinuria on Day -14 than those on placebo. Lymphocyte counts were low at screening in all patients. IgG decline continued following initiation (Day 1) of atacicept. Three atacicept-treated patients developed serum IgG below the protocol-defined discontinuation threshold of 3 g/l, two of whom developed serious pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies are needed to characterize the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamic response of atacicept in LN patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00573157.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of mycophenolate mofetil compared with intravenous pulses of cyclophosphamide on the nonrenal manifestations of lupus nephritis. METHODS: Patients with active lupus nephritis (renal biopsy class III, IV, or V) were recruited for the study (n = 370) and treated with mycophenolate mofetil (target dosage 3 gm/day) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 gm/m(2)/month), plus tapered prednisone, for 24 weeks. Nonrenal outcomes were determined using measures of whole body disease activity, including the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) disease activity index, the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus: National Assessment (SELENA) version of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI), and immunologic variables. RESULTS: Both treatments were effective on whole body disease activity in the systems examined, as indicated by changes in the classic BILAG index. With either treatment, remission was induced, notably in the mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular/respiratory, and vasculitis systems, and flares were rare, as measured by the SELENA-SLEDAI. Levels of complement C3, C4, and CH50 and titers of anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were normalized after treatment with either mycophenolate mofetil or intravenous cyclophosphamide. CONCLUSION: In addition to the efficacy of both treatments on the renal system, this analysis showed that remission could also be induced in other systems. There was no clear difference in efficacy between mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous cyclophosphamide in ameliorating either the renal or nonrenal manifestations. Mycophenolate mofetil is, therefore, a suitable alternative to cyclophosphamide for the treatment of renal and nonrenal disease manifestations in patients with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Uncertainty exists about the efficacy and toxicity of bolus therapy with methylprednisolone or of the combination of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide in the treatment of lupus nephritis. OBJECTIVE: To determine 1) whether intensive bolus therapy with methylprednisolone is an adequate substitute for bolus therapy with cyclophosphamide and 2) whether the combination of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide is superior to bolus therapy with methylprednisolone or cyclophosphamide alone. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial with at least 5 years of follow-up. SETTING: Government referral-based research hospital. PATIENTS: 82 patients with lupus nephritis who had 10 or more erythrocytes per high-power field, cellular casts, proteinuria (> 1 g of protein per day), and a renal biopsy specimen that showed proliferative nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Bolus therapy with methylprednisolone (1 g/m2 body surface area), given monthly for at least 1 year; bolus therapy with cyclophosphamide (0.5 to 1.0 g/m2 body surface area), given monthly for 6 months and then quarterly; or bolus therapy with both methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. MEASUREMENTS: 1) Renal remission (defined as < 10 dysmorphic erythrocytes per high-power field, the absence of cellular casts, and excretion of < 1 g of protein per day without doubling of the serum creatinine level), 2) prevention of doubling of the serum creatinine level, and 3) prevention of renal failure requiring dialysis. RESULTS: Renal remission occurred in 17 of 20 patients in the combination therapy group (85%), 13 of 21 patients in the cyclophosphamide group (62%), and 7 of 24 patients in the methylprednisolone group (29%) (P < 0.001). Twenty-eight patients (43%) did not achieve renal remission. By life-table analysis, the likelihood of remission during the study period was greater in the combination therapy group than in the methylprednisolone group (P = 0.028). Combination therapy and cyclophosphamide therapy were not statistically different. Adverse events were amenorrhea (seen in 41% of the cyclophosphamide group, 43% of the combination therapy group, and 7.4% of the methylprednisolone group), cervical dysplasia (seen in 11% of the cyclophosphamide group. 7.1% of the combination therapy group, and 0% of the methylprednisolone group), avascular necrosis (seen in 11% of the cyclophosphamide group, 18% of the combination therapy group, and 22% of the methylprednisolone group), herpes zoster (seen in 15% of the cyclophosphamide group, 21% of the combination therapy group, and 3.7% of the methylprednisolone group) and at least one infection (seen in 26% of the cyclophosphamide group. 32% of the combination therapy group, and 7.4% of the methylprednisolone group). CONCLUSIONS: Monthly bolus therapy with methylprednisolone was less effective than monthly bolus therapy with cyclophosphamide. A trend toward greater efficacy with combination therapy was seen.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of treatment with either pulse cyclophosphamide (CYC) or azathioprine (AZA) combined with methylprednisolone (MP), on serial biopsy results in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, and to evaluate the predictive value of various histopathologic and clinical parameters with regard to disease outcome. METHODS: Biopsy specimens from patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, obtained at study entry and after 2 years of therapy, were scored according to a standardized method, and results assessed in relation to disease outcome. RESULTS: Of the 87 patients originally enrolled, 39 underwent repeat biopsy. These patients were representative of the overall group, both at entry and at 2-year followup. The median activity index changed from 8.0 to 2.7 (no differences between the treatment groups). In the group treated with AZA plus MP (AZA group), the increase in the median chronicity index (from 2.7 to 3.8) was larger than that in the CYC group (from 2.7 to 3.0) (P = 0.050). In multivariate analyses, renal function at enrollment and after 2 years was the best predictor of renal function at the last visit, while none of the histopathologic variables (either at entry or at 2 years) added to this prediction. Comparing patients whose disease transitioned to class II with those who had persistent proliferative lupus nephritis revealed no differences between the treatment groups at either time point, and no clinical differences at 2 years. However, a higher serum creatinine level at entry and greater proteinuria at last visit were characteristic of patients who still had proliferative lupus nephritis at 2 years. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that, although both CYC and AZA are effective in reducing active lesions in lupus nephritis, progression of chronic lesions is more effectively halted by CYC. Variables assessed by repeat biopsy do not predict clinical outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessing renal biopsies from patients with lupus nephritis (LN) is a difficult task and it is subject to interobserver variability. In this study the interobserver agreement amongst five nephropathologists was analysed. METHODS: Five specialized nephropathologists scored 126 biopsies, comprising 87 first and 39 repeat biopsies from 87 patients with biopsy-proven proliferative LN, included in a randomized controlled trial. The interobserver agreement [expressed as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)] of the scored histopathological items was calculated. Also, the WHO1995 and ISN/RPS2003 classification systems for LN were compared, with extra attention being given to the comparison between patients with diffuse proliferative LN with either segmental (IV-S) or global (IV-G) lesions. RESULTS: There was a wide range of agreement. A good interobserver agreement (ICC>0.6) was present in 15%, and a moderate interobserver agreement (ICC 0.4-0.6) in 31% of the scored items. The activity index for LN showed a good (ICC 0.716) and the chronicity index a moderate (ICC 0.494) interobserver agreement. Both classification systems showed low agreement, although consensus was easily reached. Patients classified as IV-S (n=15) had more favorable clinical parameters at study entry than those with class IV-G (n=57). Although suggested by others, we found no differences in outcome between these two subclasses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that, although definitions were agreed upon beforehand, even specialized on nephropathologists have difficulties with scoring histopathological characteristics of LN, particularly with SLE the classification systems.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence and course of anti-chromatin (anti-nucleosome, anti-double-stranded (ds) DNA and anti-histone) and anti-C1q autoantibodies in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN), treated in a randomised controlled trial with either cyclophosphamide or azathioprine plus methylprednisolone. METHODS: Autoantibody levels were measured and analysed in 52 patients with proliferative LN, during their first year of treatment. Levels in both treatment arms were compared and associations with clinical, serological and outcome parameters were studied. RESULTS: At study entry, prevalences for anti-nucleosome, anti-dsDNA, anti-histone and anti-C1q autoantibodies were 81%, 96%, 23% and 65%, respectively. Anti-chromatin autoantibodies correlated with each other, but not with anti-C1q levels. If patients were divided for their autoantibody titre at the start of treatment above or below the median, the only significant differences were higher SLE disease activity index with higher anti-nucleosome, and higher creatinine with higher anti-C1q autoantibodies. During the first year, a comparable rapid decline in the levels of anti-nucleosome, anti-dsDNA and anti-C1q autoantibodies was seen in both treatment arms. Anti-histone autoantibody levels were low and did not change. Renal flares were not preceded by rises in autoantibody titres. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that measurement of anti-chromatin and anti-C1q autoantibodies is useful for diagnosing LN, but not for monitoring disease course.

AB  - Until recently, intravenous cyclophosphamide pulses with oral corticosteroids were regarded standard therapy for proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). Azathioprine, a less toxic alternative, was never proven to be inferior. In the first Dutch lupus nephritis study (enrollment between 1995 and 2001), we randomized 87 proliferative LN patients to either cyclophosphamide pulses (750 mg/m(2), 13 pulses in 2 years) combined with oral prednisone (CY) or to azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day in 2 years) combined with intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone (3 x 3 pulses of 1000 mg) and oral prednisone (AZA). After a median follow-up of 5.7 years (interquartile range 4.1-7.2 years), doubling of serum creatinine was more frequent in the AZA group, although not statistically significant (relative risk (RR): 4.1, with 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.8-20.4). Relapses occurred more often in the AZA group (RR: 8.8, 95% CI: 1.5-31.8). Creatinine and proteinuria at last visit did not differ between the two treatment arms. Moreover, 88.4% of the patients in the AZA arm were still free of cyclophosphamide treatment. During the first 2 years, the frequency of remission was not different, but infections, especially herpes zoster virus infections (HZV) were more frequent in the AZA group. Parameters for ovarian function did not differ between the two groups. In conclusion, in this open-label randomized controlled trial, cyclophosphamide was superior to azathioprine with regard to renal relapses and HZV. At last follow-up, there were no differences in serum creatinine or proteinuria between the two groups. However, since our study lacked sufficient power, longer follow-up is needed to reveal putative differences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study prospectively the effect of treatment with cyclophosphamide pulses (CYC) or azathioprine with methylprednisolone (AZA), both for 24-month periods, on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) in a randomized controlled trial. We expected better HRQOL during AZA treatment. METHODS: HRQOL and disease activity were measured at start and after 12 and 24 months. Generic questionnaires [patient's visual analog scale (VAS), Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), Profile of Mood States] and a disease-specific measure [Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Symptom Checklist] were used. Treatment burden was assessed at 24 months. Disease activity was measured with the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and physician's VAS. RESULTS: Complete questionnaire data were available from 47 of the 87 patients included in the trial. These patients were representative of the whole group, except that completers were more often Caucasian. HRQOL scores improved significantly during treatment, particularly during the first year, on both generic and disease-specific outcomes. No statistically significant differences were found in HRQOL between the CYC and AZA groups, except for the SF-36 mental component summary scale, which showed more favorable scores in the AZA group. The mean reported treatment burden at 24 months was significantly higher in the CYC group. HRQOL scores did not correlate with the SLEDAI and physician's VAS. The disease activity measures correlated positively with each other. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with proliferative LN with immunosuppressive drugs and corticosteroids improves HRQOL, particularly in the first year. Due to the small groups studied, the absence of differences between AZA and CYC for most HRQOL scales should be interpreted cautiously: our data suggest that there may be no significant differences. Differences were a higher perceived treatment burden and worse mental HRQOL in the CYC group.

AB  - A prospective, randomized drug trial compared prednisone (60 mg per day initially) to azathioprine (3 to 4 mg/kg of body weight - day initially) plus prednisone in 24 patients with life-threatening systemic lupus erythematosus. Each group contained patients matched for age, sex, disease duration, previous therapy, and clinical and laboratory features of lupus erythematosus. During a mean follow-up period of 18 to 24 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups in number of deaths, renal or extrarenal manifestations of disease, serum complement levels, DNA antibodies, antinuclear antibody titers, lupus erythematosus cells, or Coombs' antibodies. There was no convincing evidence of a steroid-sparing effect of azathioprine. Side effects attributable to steroids were equally common in both groups; infections were not increased in the combination therapy group. Azathioprine was hepatotoxic in doses of 200 mg daily or more. Azathioprine was not a useful adjunct to corticosterolds in short-term therapy of a small number of patients with severe systemic lupus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term immunosuppressive treatment does not efficiently prevent relapses of lupus nephritis (LN). This investigator-initiated randomised trial tested whether mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was superior to azathioprine (AZA) as maintenance treatment. METHODS: A total of 105 patients with lupus with proliferative LN were included. All received three daily intravenous pulses of 750 mg methylprednisolone, followed by oral glucocorticoids and six fortnightly cyclophosphamide intravenous pulses of 500 mg. Based on randomisation performed at baseline, AZA (target dose: 2 mg/kg/day) or MMF (target dose: 2 g/day) was given at week 12. Analyses were by intent to treat. Time to renal flare was the primary end point. Mean (SD) follow-up of the intent-to-treat population was 48 (14) months. RESULTS: The baseline clinical, biological and pathological characteristics of patients allocated to AZA or MMF did not differ. Renal flares were observed in 13 (25%) AZA-treated and 10 (19%) MMF-treated patients. Time to renal flare, to severe systemic flare, to benign flare and to renal remission did not statistically differ. Over a 3-year period, 24 h proteinuria, serum creatinine, serum albumin, serum C3, haemoglobin and global disease activity scores improved similarly in both groups. Doubling of serum creatinine occurred in four AZA-treated and three MMF-treated patients. Adverse events did not differ between the groups except for haematological cytopenias, which were statistically more frequent in the AZA group (p=0.03) but led only one patient to drop out. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer renal flares were observed in patients receiving MMF but the difference did not reach statistical significance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To update the follow-up of the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial (ELNT), a randomised prospective trial comparing low-dose (LD) and high-dose (HD) intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CY) followed by azathioprine (AZA) as treatment for proliferative lupus nephritis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for survival and kidney function were prospectively collected during a 10-year period for the 90 patients randomised in the ELNT, except in 6 lost to follow-up. RESULTS: Death, sustained doubling of serum creatinine and end-stage renal disease rates did not differ between the LD and HD group (5/44 (11%) vs 2/46 (4%), 6/44 (14%) vs 5/46 (11%) and 2/44 (5%) vs 4/46 (9%), respectively) nor did mean serum creatinine, 24 h proteinuria and damage score at last follow-up. Most patients in both groups were still treated with glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressant agents and blood pressure lowering drugs. After 10 years of follow-up, the positive predictive value for a good outcome of an early drop in proteinuria in response to initial immunosuppressive therapy was confirmed. CONCLUSION: The data confirm that a LD IVCY regimen followed by AZA-the "Euro-Lupus regimen"-achieves good clinical results in the very long term.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial (ELNT), 90 patients with lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to a high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (IV CYC) regimen (6 monthly pulses and 2 quarterly pulses with escalating doses) or a low-dose IV CYC regimen (6 pulses of 500 mg given at intervals of 2 weeks), each of which was followed by azathioprine (AZA). After a median followup of 41 months, a difference in efficacy between the 2 regimens was not observed. The present analysis was undertaken to extend the followup and to identify prognostic factors. METHODS: Renal function was prospectively assessed quarterly in all 90 patients except 5 who were lost to followup. Survival curves were derived using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: After a median followup of 73 months, there was no significant difference in the cumulative probability of end-stage renal disease or doubling of the serum creatinine level in patients who received the low-dose IV CYC regimen versus those who received the high-dose regimen. At long-term followup, 18 patients (8 receiving low-dose and 10 receiving high-dose treatment) had developed permanent renal impairment and were classified as having poor long-term renal outcome. We demonstrated by multivariate analysis that early response to therapy at 6 months (defined as a decrease in serum creatinine level and proteinuria <1 g/24 hours) was the best predictor of good long-term renal outcome. CONCLUSION: Long-term followup of patients from the ELNT confirms that, in lupus nephritis, a remission-inducing regimen of low-dose IV CYC followed by AZA achieves clinical results comparable with those obtained with a high-dose regimen. Early response to therapy is predictive of good long-term renal outcome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Glomerulonephritis is a severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that is usually treated with an extended course of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC). Given the side effects of this regimen, we evaluated the efficacy and the toxicity of a course of low-dose IV CYC prescribed as a remission-inducing treatment, followed by azathioprine (AZA) as a remission-maintaining treatment. METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective clinical trial (the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial [ELNT]), we randomly assigned 90 SLE patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis to a high-dose IV CYC regimen (6 monthly pulses and 2 quarterly pulses; doses increased according to the white blood cell count nadir) or a low-dose IV CYC regimen (6 fortnightly pulses at a fixed dose of 500 mg), each of which was followed by AZA. Intent-to-treat analyses were performed. RESULTS: Followup continued for a median of 41.3 months in the low-dose group and 41 months in the high-dose group. Sixteen percent of those in the low-dose group and 20% of those in the high-dose group experienced treatment failure (not statistically significant by Kaplan-Meier analysis). Levels of serum creatinine, albumin, C3, 24-hour urinary protein, and the disease activity scores significantly improved in both groups during the first year of followup. Renal remission was achieved in 71% of the low-dose group and 54% of the high-dose group (not statistically significant). Renal flares were noted in 27% of the low-dose group and 29% of the high-dose group. Although episodes of severe infection were more than twice as frequent in the high-dose group, the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The data from the ELNT indicate that in European SLE patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, a remission-inducing regimen of low-dose IV CYC (cumulative dose 3 gm) followed by AZA achieves clinical results comparable to those obtained with a high-dose regimen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled trials in lupus nephritis have demonstrated that cyclophosphamide therapy is superior to corticosteroid therapy alone. The long-term effectiveness and side-effect profiles of pulse immunosuppressive regimens warrant further study. OBJECTIVE: To define the long-term risk and benefit of monthly treatment with boluses of methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, or both. DESIGN: Extended follow-up (median, 11 years) of a randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: U.S. government research hospital. PATIENTS: 82 patients with proliferative lupus nephritis. MEASUREMENTS: Rates of treatment failure (defined as need for supplemental immunosuppressive therapy or doubling of serum creatinine concentration, or death) and adverse events. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat survival analysis, the likelihood of treatment failure was significantly lower in the cyclophosphamide (P = 0.04) and combination therapy (P = 0.002) groups than in the methylprednisolone group. Combination therapy and cyclophosphamide therapy alone did not differ statistically in terms of effectiveness or adverse events. Of patients who completed the protocol (n = 65), the proportion of patients who had doubling of serum creatinine concentration was significantly lower in the combination group than in the cyclophosphamide group (relative risk, 0.095 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.842]). CONCLUSION: With extended follow-up, pulse cyclophosphamide continued to show superior efficacy over pulse methylprednisolone alone for treatment of lupus nephritis. The combination of pulse cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone appears to provide additional benefit over pulse cyclophosphamide alone and does not confer additional risk for adverse events.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Immunosuppressive agents have become the standard of therapy for proliferative lupus nephritis, but some patients may relapse after discontinuing treatment. We reviewed the cases of renal flares in a cohort of patients who participated in 2 randomized controlled clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health and explored the prevalence, outcome, and predictive factors of renal flares. METHODS: Data were obtained on 145 patients treated with pulse cyclophosphamide, pulse methylprednisolone, or the combination of both. Patients had not received immunosuppressive therapy for at least 6 months and had experienced complete or partial response according to defined criteria. Renal flares were classified as either proteinuric or nephritic based on changes in urinary protein and sediment. Most patients who experienced a flare received additional immunosuppressive therapy. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients had a complete response, and 19 had partial response/stabilization. Forty-one of these patients (45%) experienced renal flares (nephritic in 33, proteinuric in 8) after a mean followup of 117 months; 31 of them received additional immunosuppressive therapy. The median time to renal flare was 36 months in the complete responders and 18 months in the partial responders. Eleven of the 41 patients (27%) progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); 9 had nephritic flares (all severe except for 1) and 2 had proteinuric flares (1 in each responder group). Compared with patients who had a complete response, those with a partial response were more likely to experience a flare, to have a severe nephritic flare, or to progress to ESRD. Low C4 at the time of response and African American ethnicity were significant independent risk factors for renal flare, by multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. CONCLUSION: Nephritic flares are common in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis, even in those with a complete response to therapy, but they do not necessarily result in loss of renal function if treated with additional immunosuppressive agents. Renal flares are an important feature of the natural history of lupus nephritis and provide an opportunity for additional preventive strategies, as well as measures of efficacy in future therapeutic trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) as induction treatment for lupus nephritis (LN), by race, ethnicity and geographical region. METHODS: A total of 370 patients with active Class III-V LN received MMF (target dose 3.0 g/day) or IVC (0.5-1.0 g/m(2)/month), plus tapered prednisone, for 24 weeks. Renal function, global disease activity, immunological complement (C3 and C4) and anti-dsDNA levels are the outcomes that were assessed in this study. RESULTS: MMF was not superior to IVC as induction treatment (primary objective). There were important pre-specified interactions between treatment and race (P = 0.047) and treatment and region (P = 0.069) (primary endpoint). MMF and IVC response rates were similar for Asians (53.2 vs 63.9%; P = 0.24) and Whites (56.0 vs 54.2%; P = 0.83), but differed in the combined Other and Black group (60.4 vs 38.5%; P = 0.03). Fewer patients in the Black (40 vs 53.9%; P = 0.39) and Hispanic (38.8 vs 60.9%; P = 0.011) groups responded to IVC. Latin American patients had lower response to IVC (32 vs 60.7%; P = 0.003). Baseline disease characteristics were not predictive of response. The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar across groups. Serious AEs were slightly more prevalent among Asians. CONCLUSIONS: MMF and IVC have similar efficacy overall to short-term induction therapy for LN. However, race, ethnicity and geographical region may affect treatment response; more Black and Hispanic patients responded to MMF than IVC. As these factors are inter-related, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions about their importance.

AB  - To compare the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with that of azathioprine (AZA) drugs in the maintenance therapy of lupus nephritis (LN) patients, we studied 81 Sudanese patients with LN (32 in Class III, 34 in Class IV, and 15 in combined Class V + IV of the ISN/RPS 2003 Classification). All patients received induction therapy consisting of monthly intravenous pulse doses of cyclophosphamide (CYC) (500 mg/m 2 of body-surface area) for six months, plus three consecutive pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone 15 mg/kg/day of body weight (maximum 500 mg). Subsequently, 41 (50.6%) patients were randomized into a group that received oral MMF (22 mg/kg/day), and 40 (49.4%) patients randomized to a group that received oral AZA (2 mg/kg/day). All patients initially received oral prednisone (1 mg/kg of body weight daily) for four weeks. The baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar. Total remission rate was 75.3% (80.5% in MMF and 70% in AZA), complete remission rate of 54.3% (56.1% with MMF and 52.5% with AZA), and a partial remission rate of 21% (24.4% with MMF and 17.5% with AZA) over 29 months. During maintenance therapy, six patients died (four in the AZA group and two in the MMF group), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) developed in five patients (three in the AZA group and two in the MMF group). During the 36-months of the study, both groups had comparable event-free survival rate for the composite end point of death or ESRD and rate of relapse-free survival. Furthermore, both groups had no significant differences in terms of frequency of hospitalization, amenorrhea, infection, nausea, and vomiting. We conclude that our study showed that short-term therapy with intravenous CYC followed by maintenance therapy with oral MMF or AZA had similar efficacy and safety for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe LN.

AB  - We conducted a prospective multicenter, opened-label, parallel, randomized, controlled trial to compare tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for induction and maintenance therapy in lupus nephritis (LN). Adult patients with biopsy-proven LN International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classes III-V and active nephritis were to receive prednisolone (0.7-1.0 mg/kg/day for four weeks of run-in period and tapered) and randomly assigned to receive TAC (0.1 mg/kg/day) or MMF (1.5-2 g/day) as induction therapy for six months. All patients who had remission received azathioprine (AZA) 1-2 mg/kg/day as standard treatment in the maintenance phase. The primary outcome was Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K) at six and 12 months, and the secondary outcomes included renal SLEDAI, non-renal SLEDAI, modified SLEDAI-2K, immunity SLEDAI, and disease activity remission. Eighty-four patients were randomized. One patient who was randomized to the TAC group withdrew from the study immediately after randomization. Therefore, 42 patients received MMF and 41 patients received TAC. Disease activity remission rate and time to disease activity remission were similar in both groups. Twelve patients (28.57%) in the MMF group and 10 patients (24.39%) in the TAC group achieved disease activity remission. For disease activity scores, both regimens significantly improved SLEDAI-2K during induction and maintenance therapy. Overall, SLEDAI-2K score in the MMF group decreased more compared with the TAC group. In the MMF group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 11.6 ± 4.8 to 6.3 ± 3.9 after induction therapy and to 5.4 ± 4.4 after maintenance therapy. In the TAC group, mean SLEDAI-2K decreased from 9.0 ± 3.7 to 6.3 ± 5.1 after induction therapy and to 7.1 ± 5.4 after maintenance therapy. Renal SLEDAI and modified SLEDAI-2K showed a similar pattern with SLEDAI-2K. In non-renal SLEDAI and immunity SLEDAI, both regimens also resulted in decreased disease activity scores during the first two months. After that the scores were slightly increased. In the MMF group, the scores were still lower than baseline but in the TAC group were not. In conclusion, disease activity remission rate was similar in the MMF and TAC groups. For disease activity score as measured by SLEDAI-2K, TAC was comparable with MMF during induction but MMF was more effective on disease activity of active LN classes III and IV at 12 months, especially in the renal system.

AB  - This study assessed whether certain clinicopathologic variables could explain the impact of race on outcome in 86 patients who had severe lupus nephritis and were available for long-term follow-up after participating in a prospective, controlled, clinical trial. Fifty-four (63%) patients were white, 21 (24%) were black, and 11 (13%) were categorized as other. The proportion of patients with anti-Ro, anti-nRNP, and anti-Sm was significantly greater among black patients. Biopsies with segmental active proliferative and necrotizing lesions that involved >or=50% of glomeruli +/- membranous glomerulonephritis (class III >or=50%+/-V) were significantly more common (white 44%, black 76%, other 36%; P < 0.05) and diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis +/- membranous glomerulonephritis (class IV+/-V) was less common (white 54%, black 24%, other 64%) among black patients. Attainment of a remission was greatest among white patients (white 52%, black 29%, other 27%; P = 0.09). Features that were predictive of a remission were white race, baseline serum creatinine, and class IV+/-V lesions. Patient survival at 10 yr (white 81%, black 59%, other 73%; P = 0.029) and renal survival at 10 yr (white 68%, black 38%, other 61%; P = 0.015) were significantly poorer in black patients. Predictors of ESRD were serum creatinine, the presence of anti-Ro antibodies, class III >or=50%+/-V lesions, and failure to achieve a remission. In conclusion, racial differences were observed in the serologic and histologic features at presentation, response to treatment, and outcome of patients with severe lupus nephritis. In a population of patients with severe lupus nephritis, black patients were significantly more likely to have a serologic profile and renal lesions that were associated with more aggressive renal disease and resulted in worse outcomes than white patients.

AB  - The Lupus Nephritis Collaborative Study (LNCS) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial designed to assess the effects of standard drug therapy alone versus drug therapy plus plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) on the incidence of fatal or nonfatal renal failure associated with lupus nephritis. After 86 patients had been entered, with a mean of 97 weeks of follow-up, the trial was terminated partly due to lack of a beneficial effect of plasmapheresis. Although there are numerous methods for the statistical analysis of emerging results in a clinical trial, there have been relatively few descriptions of the application of these methods to the termination of a clinical trial when no favorable difference exists between groups. This report presents a review of the statistical methods employed for the pivotal interim analyses of the LNCS that were performed in order to help reach the decision to terminate the trial. These included the assessment of unconditional power post-hoc and the assessment of conditional power using an exact method appropriate for small sample sizes. Conditional power was used to assess the likelihood of detecting a significant treatment effect in the future given the data thus far observed and given reasonable hypotheses regarding the nature of the possible differences between the treatment groups. In addition, weighted-likelihood ratios (Bayes odds ratios) were computed to assess the likelihood of various alternative hypotheses given the present data. We show how such analyses can be useful in reaching a decision to terminate a trial that fails to show a treatment effect.

MEASUREMENTS: Initial clinical and pathologic features, response to therapy within 48 weeks, and subsequent clinical events, including development of renal failure. MAIN RESULTS: Renal failure developed in 18 patients (21%). An observed elevation in serum creatinine concentration was the only initial feature predictive of subsequent renal failure. Mean (+/- SD) initial serum creatinine levels were higher in patients who subsequently developed renal failure (244 +/- 134 mumol/L [2.76 +/- 1.52 mg/dL] compared with 163 +/- 103 mumol/L [1.85 +/- 1.17 mg/dL]; P = 0.007). The risk for renal failure was higher among patients with initial serum creatinine levels greater than 106 mumol/L (1.2 mg/dL) (29% compared with 6.5%; P = 0.014). Response to therapy (defined as resolution of initial serum creatinine elevations within 48 weeks) refined the prognosis based on initial serum creatinine determinations. The risk for subsequent renal failure was higher among patients who failed to respond to therapy within 48 weeks (30% compared with 0%; P = 0.015). By comparison, 9% of patients with normal initial serum creatinine levels progressed to renal failure after 48 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Initial serum creatinine levels and responses to initial therapy with prednisone and short-term cyclophosphamide, as used in the LNCS, can guide further therapy. Patients with normal initial serum creatinine levels or resolution of initial serum creatinine elevations within 48 weeks have a low risk for renal failure and may not require long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who have glomerulonephritis is poor, despite treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Plasmapheresis therapy has been used, but there have been few controlled clinical observations of its efficacy. METHODS: We carried out a randomized, controlled trial comparing a standard-therapy regimen of prednisone and cyclophosphamide (standard therapy) with a regimen of standard therapy plus plasmapheresis in 86 patients with severe lupus nephritis in 14 medical centers. The patients underwent plasmapheresis three times weekly for four weeks. Drug therapy was standardized, with strict adherence to nine detailed medical-management protocols. RESULTS: Forty-six patients received standard therapy, and 40 patients received standard therapy plus plasmapheresis. The mean follow-up was 136 weeks. Six patients (13 percent) in the standard-therapy group and eight patients (20 percent) in the plasmapheresis group died. Renal failure developed in 8 patients (17 percent) in the standard-therapy group, as compared with 10 (25 percent) in the plasmapheresis group. Thirty patients (35 percent) reached stopping points--14 (30 percent) in the standard-therapy group and 16 (40 percent) in the plasmapheresis group. A similar number of patients in each group had a decrease in both the serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion to approximately normal values. Patients treated with plasmapheresis had a significantly more rapid reduction of serum concentrations of antibodies against double-stranded DNA and cryoglobulins. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with plasmapheresis plus a standard regimen of prednisone and cyclophosphamide therapy does not improve the clinical outcome in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and severe nephritis, as compared with the standard regimen alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess if combination rituximab and cyclophosphamide is more effective than rituximab monotherapy as an induction therapy for proliferative lupus nephritis. METHODS: A randomized open-label pilot study in which 9 patients received rituximab alone and 10 patients received two doses rituximab + intravenous cyclophosphamide. The clinical, laboratory and renal histological changes were assessed after 48 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: At week 48, four patients had a complete response, 11 patients achieved partial response, 2 patients remained the same or stable and 2 worsened. There were no statistical differences in the proportion of patients with complete or partial response between the two groups. None of the variables was an independent predictor of response at week 48. Nine patients had significant improvement in activity indices in renal biopsies, but there were no significant differences between the two groups. Overall, 18 out of 19 patients were found to have effective B-cell depletion. The median duration of complete B-cell depletion in all patients was 22 weeks. There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of patients with complete depletion at weeks 4, 8, 24 and 48 between the two groups except at week 2. CONCLUSIONS: Rituximab monotherapy appears to be effective as induction therapy in lupus nephritis. The addition of cyclophosphamide offers no additional improvement in clinical, laboratory and renal histological assessment or the duration of B-cell depletion at 48 weeks. Large-scale studies with longer duration are needed to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the use of aggressive immunosuppression has improved both patient and renal survival of patients with lupus nephritis (LN), the optimal treatment of LN remains challenging. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) as induction therapies for active lupus nephritis (ALN). METHODS: In this open-label, 24-week prospective study, 60 patients with biopsy-proven ALN (Classes III, IV, V or combination) were randomly assigned to receive MMF, tacrolimus or IVC in combination with corticosteroids. The remission of proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus disease active index and adverse events were compared. RESULTS: The response rates at 24 weeks were 70% (14/20) in the MMF group, 75% (15/20) in the tacrolimus group and 60% (12/20) in the IVC group (P>0.05). The complete remission rates were also similar in the three groups (40, 45 and 30%, respectively; P>0.05). There were more cases of infection in the IVC group (8/20) and the MMF group (8/20) than the tacrolimus group (3/20) and more hyperglycemia in the tacrolimus group (5/20) than the other two groups (2 or 3/20), but the results were not statistically significant among the three groups. Proteinuria decreased and serum albumin increased more quickly in the patients treated with tacrolimus (P=0.0051 and P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that both MMF and tacrolimus are possible alternatives to IVC as induction therapies for ALN in Chinese patients. Tacrolimus possibly results in a faster resolution of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. Further studies are necessary to determine the optimal dosage and duration of the therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) remains challenging. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of a multitarget therapy consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide and steroid as induction therapy for LN. DESIGN: 24-week randomized, open-label, multicenter study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00876616). SETTING: 26 renal centers in China. PATIENTS: Adults (aged 18 to 65 years) with biopsy-proven LN. INTERVENTION: Tacrolimus, 4 mg/d, and mycophenolate mofetil, 1.0 g/d, versus intravenous cyclophosphamide with a starting dose of 0.75 (adjusted to 0.5 to 1.0) g/m2 of body surface area every 4 weeks for 6 months. Both groups received 3 days of pulse methylprednisolone followed by a tapering course of oral prednisone therapy. MEASUREMENTS: The primary end point was complete remission at 24 weeks. Secondary end points included overall response (complete and partial remission), time to overall response, and adverse events. RESULTS: After 24 weeks of therapy, more patients in the multitarget group (45.9%) than in the intravenous cyclophosphamide group (25.6%) showed complete remission (difference, 20.3 percentage points [95% CI, 10.0 to 30.6 percentage points]; P < 0.001). The overall response incidence was higher in the multitarget group than in the intravenous cyclophosphamide group (83.5% vs. 63.0%; difference, 20.4 percentage points [CI, 10.3 to 30.6 percentage points]; P < 0.001), and the median time to overall response was shorter in the multitarget group (difference, -4.1 weeks [CI, -7.9 to -2.1 weeks]). Incidence of adverse events did not differ between the multitarget and intravenous cyclophosphamide groups (50.3% [91 of 181] vs. 52.5% [95 of 181]). LIMITATION: The study was limited to 24 weeks of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Multitarget therapy provides superior efficacy compared with intravenous cyclophosphamide as induction therapy for LN.

AB  - This was a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of immunoadsorption (IA) versus conventional PP (PP) as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of severe lupus nephritis (LN). Of 28 patients with biopsy-proven severe LN (ISN/RPS classes III or IV ± V), 14 underwent 36 sessions of PP and the other 41 sessions of IA in addition to our center's standard LN treatment protocol. Three patients in the PP group and 2 in the IA group experienced a transient, marked drop in platelets with the second session. Except for a higher pre treatment mean SLEDAI score in the PP group 17.4 ± 2.0 vs. 13.5 ± 4.8; p = 0.009 and a serum creatinine of 163 ± 7.9 vs. 81.7 ± 10.2; p = 0.33, there were no other baseline differences. Some differences did exist between the two therapies in the immediate post-treatment phase, at 1 and 3 months. Three in IA relapsed, none of PP in third months, whereas two patients relapsed in the PP and none of IA cohorts at 6 months. However, most of these parameters did not differ by 6 months. The pre- and post-therapy SLEDAI scores remained different 12.4 ± 4.5 vs. 9 ± 4; p = 0.04 at 1 month, and at 3 month 13.5 ± 4.7 vs. 7.7 ± 1.1; p = 0.012 but not at 6 months. We conclude that IA and PP were equally well tolerated and efficacious as adjunctive therapy for severe LN.

AB  - Cyclophosphamide (CYC) has been the backbone immunosuppressive drug to achieve sustained remission in lupus nephritis (LN). The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and compare adverse effects of low and high dose intravenous CYC therapy in Indian patients with proliferative lupus nephritis. An open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial involving 75 patients with class III/IV LN was conducted after obtaining informed consent. The low dose group (n = 38) received 6 × 500 mg CYC fortnightly and high dose group (n = 37) received 6 × 750 mg/m(2) CYC four-weekly followed by azathioprine. The primary outcome was complete/partial/no response at 52 weeks. The secondary outcomes were renal and non-renal flares and adverse events. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. At 52 weeks, 27 (73%) in high dose group achieved complete/partial response (CR/PR) vs 19 (50%) in low dose (p = 0.04). CR was higher in the high dose vs low dose [24 (65%) vs 17 (44%)], although not statistically significant. Non-responders (NR) in the high dose group were also significantly lower 10 (27%) vs low dose 19 (50%) (p = 0.04). The change in the SLEDAI (Median, IQR) was also higher in the high dose 16 (7-20) in contrast to the low dose 10 (5.5-14) (p = 0.04). There was significant alopecia and CYC-induced leucopenia in high dose group. Renal relapses were significantly higher in the low dose group vs high dose [9 (24%) vs 1(3%), (p = 0.01)]. At 52 weeks, high dose CYC was more effective in inducing remission with decreased renal relapses in our population. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at http://www.clintrials.gov . NCT02645565.

AB  - Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is used extensively for the induction therapy of lupus nephritis (LN) and has even outpaced intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (CyP) as the initial choice of therapy. There are no studies comparing the response of MMF with standard dose i.v. CyP in Indian patients with LN. We conducted a 24-week prospective, randomized, open-label trial comparing oral MMF with monthly i.v. CyP as induction therapy for active biopsy proven Class III and IV LN. The primary end-point was response to treatment at 24 weeks, and the secondary end-points were complete remission, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index scores (SLEDAI) and adverse reactions. Of the 40 patients, 17 were randomized to the MMF group and 23 to the i.v. CyP group. Complete remission was seen in nine (52.94%) patients in the MMF group and 11 (47.82%) in the i.v. CyP group. Partial remission was seen in six (35.30%) in the MMF group and nine (39.13%) in the i.v. CyP group. At six months, the cumulative probability of response was not statistically significant between the two groups (P = 1.000). MMF is comparable to i.v. CyP in the management of LN in Indian patients having an equal safety profile. The dose of MMF required was lower than the conventional doses used in other studies suggesting genetic or environmental factors in the Indian population influencing the metabolism of MMF, which requires further evaluation. The cost of MMF is a limiting factor in its use. The use of i.v. CyP is favorable as the monthly doses ensure compliance and is also cost-effective.

AB  - To evaluate the outcome of low doses of cyclophosphamide (Cyclo) therapy in lupus nephritis (LN) patients, we studied 117 biopsy-proven, de novo LN WHO class IV patients double-blinded and randomized in December 1997 to receive Cyclo in different doses; Group I (n=73) received Cyclo 10 mg/kg monthly for six months then every two months for 12 months. Group II (n=44) received Cyclo 5 mg/kg monthly for six months then every two months for 36 months. The patients were followed-up till January 2007. Six months post-induction values for creatinine clearance were significantly higher in Group I (67.7 ± 28.6 mL/min) compared with Group II (55.1 ± 30.1 mL/min), P = 0.026. Serum C4 and ANA were not significantly different between the groups (P > 0.05). At the mean follow-up of 6.77 ± 3.3 years, the mean creatinine clearance was 44.74 ± 31.7 mL/min in Group I vs. 49.3 ± 38.8 in Group II. Urinary protein was 1.65 ± 1.8 g/dL in Group I vs. 1.02 ± 1.01 in Group II (P = 0.03). The survival curve showed that kidney survival overtime was comparable in both groups (P = 0.2). Complete remission was observed in 25 (34.2%) patients in Group I vs. 11 (25%) in Group II (P = 0.288), while partial remission was similar in both groups; 43 (58.9%) patients in Group I vs. 26 (59%) patients in Group II. End-stage renal disease was observed in 10 (13.7%) patients in Group I vs. 9 (20.4%) patients in Group II (P = 0.359). Side-effects were more frequent in Group I patients than in Group II patients; gonadal toxicity and malignancy were lower in Group II patients (P = 0.0000). Moreover, different infections occurred in 23 (31.3%) patients vs. six (13.6%), digital infarcts occurred in 1.35% vs. 0%, diabetes in 4.1% vs. 2.27%, and vasculitis in 4.1% vs. 2.27% in Group I vs. Group II, respectively. Sustained amenorrhea without pregnancy was observed in both groups; however, significantly more in Group I patients, P ≤ 0.05. We conclude that low-dose Cyclo therapy is sufficiently effective for WHO class IV LN patients with lower side-effects compared with standard dose.

AB  - Background/Purpose: To study the factors associated with renal remission, relapse and renal function decline in patients with lupus nephritis treated with combined steroid and MMF or Tac. Method(s): Data were extracted from a RCT of the efficacy of MMF vs Tac for induction treatment of lupus nephritis. All patients recruited were treated with high-dose prednisolone with either MMF (2-3g/day) or Tac (0.1-0.06mg/kg/day) for 6 months. Patients with good clinical response were shifted to azathioprine (AZA) for maintenance. Rescue therapies were given to patients who did not respond to induction. Factors associated with complete renal response (CR), relapse and renal function decline at 5 years were studied by regression analyses. Result(s): 150 patients (92% women) with lupus nephritis were studied (Class III+/-V 36%; IVG/S+/-V 46; pure V 19%; age 35.5+/-12.8 years; SLE duration 50.2+/-62 months). At baseline, 59(39%) patients were hypertensive and 67% patients had CrCl <90ml/min. At 6m, 61% patients achieved CR, 24% had partial response (PR) but 15% patients had no response (NR). Logistic regression revealed that the baseline urine P/Cr ratio (OR 0.75[0.57-0.99]; p=0.04) and the presence of membranous feature on renal histology (OR 0.25[0.07-0.91]; p=0.04) were independently associated with CR at 6m. AZA maintenance was given to 59 (78%) MMF-treated (dose 82.5+/-24 mg/day) and 60 (81%) TAC-treated patients (dose 86.5+/-21 mg/day; p=0.32). Patients with NR were re-induced with CYC (N=20), low-dose combination of MMF and TAC (N=5), crossover to TAC or MMF (N=6). After a follow-up of 60.8+/-26 months, proteinuric and nephritic renal flares occurred in 24% and 18% of patients treated initially with MMF and 35% and 27% in those treated with TAC, respectively. In patients who achieved CR or PR after initial treatment, Cox regression showed that the female sex (HR 10.9[1.19-101]; p=0.04), positive anti-dsDNA at month 6 (HR 4.95[1.64-14.9]; p=0.005) and the use of ACE inhibitor after 6 month (HR 8.86[1.28-61.2]; p=0.03) were independently associated with renal flares (proteinuric or nephritic). The cumulative incidence of a composite outcome of decline of CrCl by >=30%, development of CKD stage 4/5 or death at 5 years was 21% in patients treated with MMF and 22% in those treated with TAC. Factors significantly associated with this outcome were first time lupus nephritis (HR 0.21[0.05-0.82]; p=0.03), creatinine clearance (CrCl) at 6 month (HR 0.97[0.95-0.99]; p=0.005) and the use of AZA maintenance (HR 0.23[0.49-4.30]; p=0.046). Repeat renal biopsy in 23 patients with renal flares showed that the increase in chronicity score was similar between the MMF (1.3+/-3.0) and TAC (1.8+/-2.0) groups of patients (p=0.42). Conclusion(s): Tac is non-inferior to MMF for induction therapy of lupus nephritis. More proteinuria at baseline and the presence of histological membranous features are unfavorably associated with good renal response after induction treatment. Female patients and persistent elevation of anti-dsDNA after induction therapy are associated with renal flares. Lower creatinine clearance at 6 months and the absence of AZA maintenance are associated with renal function deterioration after 5 years.

AB  - Background/Purpose: To study the risk factors for renal function decline in patients with lupus nephritis treated initially with combined steroid and MMF or Tac. Method(s): Data were extracted from a randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of MMF vs Tac for induction treatment of lupus nephritis. All patients recruited were treated with high-dose prednisolone (0.6mg/kg/day for 6-8 weeks and tapered) with either MMF (2-3g/day) or Tac (0.1-0.06mg/ kg/day) for 6 months. Patients with good clinical response were shifted to azathioprine (AZA) (2mg/kg/day) and continued on low dose prednisolone (<10mg/day) for maintenance. Rescue therapies were given to patients who did not have response to treatment at the discretion of the attending physicians. Factors associated with renal function decline at 5 years were studied by Cox regression analyses. Result(s): 150 patients (92% women) with biopsy confirmed active lupus nephritis were studied (ISN/RPS class III 17%; IVG 31%; IVS 12%; III/IV+V 21%; pure V 20%). The mean age was 35.5+/-12.8 years and SLE duration was 50.2+/-62 months at the time of renal biopsy. 102 (68%) patients had first time glomerulonephritis while the others had relapsed disease. The mean histological activity and chronicity score was 8.2+/-3.4 and 2.6+/-1.6, respectively. 59(39%) patients were hypertensive, 62(41%) had active urinary casts and 112(75%) had microscopic hematuria at presentation. The mean creatinine clearance (CrCl) was 79.0+/-30.8 ml/min and 67% patients had CrCl less than 90ml/min. At 6 months, 61% patients achieved good clinical response, 25% had partial response but 15% patients had no response (NR) (urine P/Cr improvement <50% or >3.0 or deterioration in CrCl (>20%) +/- persistently active urinary sediments and lupus serology). Rescue regimens for NR patients included: oral or intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide (68%), Tac or MMF (14%) and MMF + Tac combination (18%). 128(85%) patients received AZA (83.1+/-23mg/day) for maintenance therapy. After a mean follow-up of 56+/-28 months, 27(18%) patients had loss of CrCl by >=30% and 17 (11%) patients developed stage 4/5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) (CrCl <30ml/min). The cumulative risk of loss of CrCl by 330% or stage 4/5 CKD was 3% at 12 months, 7.7% at 24 months, 8.4% at 36 months, 13.6% at 48 months and 17.3% at 60 months. Cox regression revealed histological activity score (HR 0.78[0.65-0.94]; p=0.007), chronicity score (1.46[1.06-2.01]; p=0.02), non-response at 6 months (HR 3.87[1.34- 11.2]; p=0.01), class V histology (HR 0.35[0.16-0.74]; p=0.006) and number of renal flares (HR 1.59[1.01-2.49; p=0.04] were independent risk factors for CrCl loss by 30% of stage 4/5 CKD, after adjustment for age, sex, SLE duration, first-time renal disease, proteinuria and CrCl at presentation and the treatment arm during induction phase (MMF or Tac). Conclusion(s): Combined prednisolone with MMF or Tac is equally effective for the initial treatment of active lupus nephritis. No response at 6 months, proliferative types of lupus nephritis, lower activity but higher chronicity score on renal biopsy and the number of renal flares are predictive of renal function decline at 5 years.

AB  - Purpose: To study the risk of renal flares and renal function deterioration in patients with active lupus nephritis treated initially with combined prednisolone and MMF. Method(s): Data were extracted from an open randomized controlled trial of the efficacy of MMF vs tacrolimus for induction treatment of lupus nephritis. All patients recruited into the MMF arm were treated with prednisolone (0.6mg/kg/day for 6 weeks and tapered) and MMF (2-3g/day) for 6 months. Patients with good clinical response were shifted to azathioprine (AZA) (2mg/kg/day) and continued on low dose prednisolone (<10mg/day) for maintenance. Renal function and clinical outcome at last visit was assessed. Factors associated with decline of renal function were analyzed by Cox regression. Result(s): Data from 56 patients who had completed the induction phase of the controlled trial were analyzed. The mean age was 36.0+/-12.8 years and SLE duration was 55.3+/-63 months. The histological classes of lupus nephritis (RPS/ISN) were IVG (32%), IVS (9%), III (21%) and V/V+III/IV (38%). The activity and chronicity scores were 7.4+/-3.6 and 2.8+/-1.6, respectively. 24(43%) patients were hypertensive and 27 (48%) were nephrotic at presentation. The mean daily MMF dosage administered was 2.20+/-0.44g (2g in 75% and >=2.5g in 25%). At 6 months, 33(59%) patients achieved good clinical response (urine P/Cr <1.0, improvement in lupus serology and urinary sediments, with no deterioration of creatinine clearance [CrCl] by >=10%) and 13(23%) patients achieved good partial response (same criteria but urine P/Cr <2.0). These patients received AZA (86.4+/-23mg/day) for maintenance therapy. At last visit (median follow-up 36 months), 20 renal flares occurred in 17 patients (13 nephritic and 7 proteinuric). The cumulative risk of renal flare was 7.3% at 12 months and 31% at 36 months. Six (11%) patients had loss of CrCl by >=30% at last visit, 5 of whom developed stage 4/5 chronic kidney disease (CrCl <=30ml/min). The cumulative risk of loss of CrCl by >=30% was 5.4% at 12 months and 7.5% at 36 months. Cox regression revealed that nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, CrCl <90ml/min at baseline, failure to achieve good response at 6 months and the occurrence of renal flares were unfavorable factors for renal function loss. Conclusion(s): Combined prednisolone and MMF is effective for the initial treatment of active lupus nephritis. However, patients with nephrotic syndrome, impaired renal function and hypertension at onset are associated with a higher risk of renal damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of tacrolimus (TAC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) for the initial therapy of lupus nephritis (LN). STUDY DESIGN: This is an open randomised controlled parallel group study. METHODS: Adult patients with biopsy-confirmed active LN (class III/IV/V) were randomised to receive prednisolone (0.6 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks and tapered) in combination with either TAC (0.06-0.1 mg/kg/day) or MMF (2-3 g/day) for 6 months. Good responders were shifted to azathioprine for maintenance. The primary outcome was the rate of complete renal response (CR) at 6 months and the secondary outcomes included partial renal response, renal flares and decline of renal function over time. RESULTS: 150 patients (92% women; aged 35.5±12.8 years; 81% class III/IV) were randomised (76 MMF, 74 TAC). At month 6, the rate of CR was 59% in the MMF and 62% in the TAC group (treatment difference: 3.0% (-12%, 18%); p=0.71). Major infective episodes occurred in 9.2% patients treated with MMF and in 5.4% patients treated with TAC (p=0.53). Maintenance therapy with azathioprine was given to 79% patients. After 60.8±26 months, proteinuric and nephritic renal flares developed in 24% and 18% of patients in the MMF group and 35% (p=0.12) and 27% (p=0.21) in the TAC group, respectively. The cumulative incidence of a composite outcome of decline of creatinine clearance by ≥30%, development of chronic kidney disease stage 4/5 or death was 21% in the MMF and 22% in the TAC group of patients (p=0.35). CONCLUSIONS: TAC is non-inferior to MMF, when combined with prednisolone, for induction therapy of active LN. With azathioprine maintenance for 5 years, a non-significant trend of higher incidence of renal flares and renal function decline is observed with the TAC regimen.

AB  - There is not agreement about the best maintenance treatment for patients with diffuse lupus nephritis. This multicenter, randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of cyclosporine and azathioprine. Seventy-five patients with diffuse proliferative lupus were given three intravenous methylprednisolone pulses followed by prednisone and oral cyclophosphamide for a median of 90 d. Subsequently, patients were randomly assigned either to cyclosporine or to azathioprine for 2 yr (core study). Treatment continued for up to 4 yr (follow-up study). The primary outcome measure was the incidence of disease flares. Secondary end points were proteinuria per day, creatinine clearance, and adverse effects. Seven flares occurred in the cyclosporine group, and eight occurred in the azathioprine group. At the end of the core study, mean proteinuria decreased from 2.8 +/- 3.57 to 0.4 +/- 0.85 g/d (P < 0.0001) in the cyclosporine group and from 2.2 +/- 1.94 to 0.5 +/- 0.78 g/d (P < 0.0002) in the azathioprine group. After 4 yr, mean proteinuria was 0.2 +/- 0.24 and 0.3 +/- 0.33 g/d, respectively. At the core study end and at the follow-up completion, creatinine clearance and BP levels did not change significantly from baseline in either group. Five of 36 patients who were receiving cyclosporine and four of the 33 who were receiving azathioprine stopped the treatment because of adverse effects. For patients with diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, azathioprine or cyclosporine combined with corticosteroids demonstrated equal efficacy in the prevention of flares.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with class III/IV lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, 400 mg ocrelizumab, or 1,000 mg ocrelizumab given as an intravenous infusion on days 1 and 15, followed by a single infusion at week 16 and every 16 weeks thereafter, accompanied by background glucocorticoids plus either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial (ELNT) regimen (cyclophosphamide followed by azathioprine). The study was terminated early due to an imbalance in serious infections in ocrelizumab-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients. We report week 48 efficacy data for patients receiving ≥32 weeks of treatment (n = 223) and safety results for all treated patients (n = 378). RESULTS: The overall renal response rate was 54.7%, 66.7%, 67.1%, and 66.9% in the placebo-treated, 400 mg ocrelizumab-treated, 1,000 mg ocrelizumab-treated, and combined ocrelizumab-treated groups, respectively. The associated treatment difference versus placebo for the combined ocrelizumab-treated groups was 12.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -0.8, 26.1) (P = 0.065), with similar differences observed for both ocrelizumab-treated groups. Ocrelizumab versus placebo treatment differences were apparent in patients receiving the background ELNT regimen, but not in those receiving background MMF. A numerically greater proportion of ocrelizumab-treated patients had a ≥50% reduction in the urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio at 48 weeks compared with placebo-treated patients (placebo-treated patients, 58.7%; 400 mg ocrelizumab-treated patients, 70.7%; 1,000 mg ocrelizumab-treated patients, 68.5%). Serious adverse events occurred in 27.2% of placebo-treated patients, 35.7% of 400 mg ocrelizumab-treated patients, and 22.0% of 1,000 mg ocrelizumab-treated patients. Corresponding serious infection rates (events/100 patient-years) were 18.7 (95% CI 12.2, 28.7), 28.8 (95% CI 20.6, 40.3), and 25.1 (95% CI 17.4, 36.1), respectively. The imbalance in serious infections with ocrelizumab occurred with background MMF but not with the background ELNT regimen. CONCLUSION: In patients with active LN, overall renal response rates with ocrelizumab were numerically but not statistically significantly superior to those with placebo. Ocrelizumab treatment was associated with a higher rate of serious infections in the subgroup receiving background MMF.

AB  - Purpose: B cells are believed to contribute to LN pathogenesis. Ocrelizumab (OCR), a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells, was studied to determine the benefits and risks of OCR compared to placebo (PBO) in patients (pts) with active class III/IV LN also receiving corticosteroids plus standard of care (SOC) of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or Eurolupus (EL) cyclophosphamide (CYC) regimen. Method(s): Pts with active proliferative LN were randomized equally to PBO, OCR 400 mg, or OCR 1000 mg IV on days 1 and 15; single infusions were then given every 16 wks. Pts received either MMF (up to 3 g/d) or EL (IV CYC 500 mg q2 wks x 6 followed by azathioprine 2 mg/kg) and a protocol-defined steroid taper regimen. The primary endpoint was the Wk 48 overall renal response (ORR) consisting of complete (CRR) and partial (PRR) renal response. We report here interim safety results for all treated pts, and Wk 48 renal responses for pts enrolled >=32 wks prior to stopping the study. Due to the smaller group sizes, inferential statistics (95% CI, p-value) are provided only for the pooled OCR group vs PBO. Result(s): 381 pts were randomized through Sept 2009. 87 % were female, 80% class IV LN, 63% received MMF and 37% EL. Mean 24hr Upr/Cr ratio at entry was 3.9. An imbalance in serious infections (in pts receiving OCR, particularly with MMF, and in pts from Asia across all arms), and in opportunistic infections (7 OCR pts vs 1 in PBO; 6/8 received MMF) led to dosing being discontinued in Oct 2009, with pts continuing into safety follow-up. Table shows the Wk 48 renal responses for the 221 "32 Wks" pts: 51% in PBO vs. 63% in OCR had an ORR, a treatment difference of 11.9% (95% CI: -1.9%, 25.7%; p=0.075), with similar overall rates in the 400 and 1000 mg arms. There was no increase in ORR observed in pts receiving 400 mg OCR+MMF vs MMF alone whereas there was an increased ORR rate with both OCR doses in OCR+EL vs EL alone, with higher ORR, and CRR rates in the 400 mg EL group. Table shows interim safety results for all treated pts (N=378). (Table Presented) Conclusion(s): In this '32 wks' population, the ORR rate at 48 wks was overall 12% higher in the OCR group. The addition of OCR 400mg to MMF did not generate additional benefit, with an increased observed rate of serious infections (SIEs). The OCR+EL regimen had a higher ORR rate vs EL alone, in both dose groups, with a lower PBO+EL ORR rate compared to the PBO+MMF group. Incidence of SAEs, SIEs, and IRRs was lower in EL pts compared to MMF pts.

AB  - Intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) in combination with steroids is standard therapy for Lupus nephritis. Reduction of autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes can be used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of IVC pulse therapy and double-filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) on proteinuria and urinary excretion of podocytes in adult patients with diffuse proliferative Lupus nephritis (DPLN). Twenty patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group A (n = 10) was treated with IVC (0.75 - 1.0 g/m2 body surface area) pulse therapy, given as boluses once a month for 6 consecutive months, combined with oral corticosteroid (up to 1 mg/kg/day) administration. Group B (n = 10) was treated with a combination of DFPP (performed 1-2 times weekly) and corticosteroid (up to I mg/kg/ day). The total average number of treatments was 8.4 and the therapeutic efficacies were evaluated after 6 months. Twenty healthy individuals participated as a control group. Urinary podocytes were examined by immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies against podocalyxin. Both Group A and Group B reduced proteinuria (p < 0.001) as well as the number of urinary podocytes (p < 0.001). Differences between the 2 treatment outcomes were not statistically significant. Cyclophosphamide pulse therapy and DFPP may be similarly effective in the treatment of podocyte injury in patients with DPLN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil in the induction therapy of proliferative lupus nephritis. METHODS: Forty-four patients from eight centres with newly diagnosed lupus nephritis World Health Organization class III or IV were randomly assigned to either mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 2 g/day for 6 months or intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) 0.75-1 g/m(2) monthly for 6 months in addition to corticosteroids. RESULTS: Remission occurred in 13 out of 25 patients (52%) in the IVC group and 11 out of 19 patients (58%) in the MMF group (P = 0.70). There were 12% in the IVC group and 26% in the MMF group that achieved complete remission (P = 0.22). Improvements in haemoglobin, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin, serum complement, proteinuria, urinary activity, renal function and the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score were similar in both groups. Twenty-four follow-up renal biopsies at the end of therapy showed a significant reduction in the activity score in both groups. The chronicity index increased in both groups but was only significant in the IVC group. Adverse events were similar. Major infections occurred in three patients in each group. There was no difference in gastrointestinal side-effects. CONCLUSIONS: MMF in combination with corticosteroids is an effective induction therapy for moderately severe proliferative lupus nephritis.

AB  - Background: The management of proliferative lupus nephritis is still evolving. Considering the complicated pathogenesis of lupus nephritis involving humoral as well as cellular immunity, a multidrug multitarget regimen may be a rational approach. Recent trials showing benefit in class IV and V lupus using multitarget approach used mycophenolate mofetyl which is replaced here by azathioprine considering cost appropriacy and a lesser potential for sepsis. Study design and settings: We report the comparison of tacrolimus-azathioprine combination regimen and intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY) as induction treatment for proliferative lupus nephritis in an open label randomized controlled study from a tertiary center in eastern India. Intervention(s): Fifty eight patients with lupus nephritis classes III and IV, with or without evidence of class V lesions, were randomly assigned to tacrolimus (0.075 mg/ kg) with azathioprine (2 mg/kg) or monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2). Both groups received 3 pulsed doses of methylprednisolone and subsequently, prednisolone was given at doses of 0.5 mg/kg/day for the next 1 month and then tapered as tolerated to 10 mg or less by 3 months. Outcome(s): The primary end point was achievement of complete renal remission. Secondary end points included partial remission of lupus nephritis, decrease of proteinuria, disease activity scoring and safety. Result(s): Complete remission occurred in 77.41% patients on the Tacrolimus-Azathioprine regimen and in 72.7% patients in the cyclophosphamide arm (p=0.9). Secondary end points were also similar between treatment groups. Major infective complications requiring hospital admission in the triple drug regimen [1 (3.2%) vs. 4(18.1%)] were less and the two groups had non-significant differences in safety and adverse events. Limitation(s): Short duration of study follow up. Conclusion(s): The Tacrolimus-Azathioprine combination regimen is at least as efficacious and safe as the IVCY regimen.

AB  - The level of renal function at biopsy is predictive of outcome in patients with severe lupus nephritis (SLN). While renal function has been based on serum creatinine (SCr) alone, measuring the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) utilizing the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation has been found to be more accurate. The MDRD eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m(2)) at biopsy was calculated in 86 patients with SLN and patients were categorized based on eGFR: ≥60 (33 pts), 59-30 (33 pts) and <30 (20 pts). An eGFR was <60 in 18% of patients with a normal SCr. After 120 ± 65 months of follow-up, attainment of a complete remission (76% versus 30% versus 10%, p < 0.0001) and patient survival without end-stage renal disease (ESRD; 10 year survival: 85% versus 45% versus 14%, p < 0.0001 overall) was highest in patients with an eGFR ≥60 and lowest in those with an eGFR <30. The long-term prognosis for patients with severe lupus nephritis and an eGFR ≥60 was extremely good. Since the prognosis for patients with an eGFR <60 was poor even in those patients with a normal SCr, renal function is more accurately determined by the MDRD eGFR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether plasmapheresis increases the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Multicenter. PATIENTS: Eighty-six patients enrolled in a trial of plasmapheresis for severe diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-six of the patients received high-dose steroid therapy plus cyclophosphamide therapy for 8 weeks. Thereafter, cyclophosphamide therapy was discontinued, and steroid therapy was tapered (standard treatment group). Forty patients received identical treatment and had 12 plasmapheresis procedures during the first 4 weeks of the treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were examined for the development of infection. MAIN RESULTS: No statistical difference in age, sex, race, serum creatinine level, proteinuria, or complement levels was found between the two groups. Over a follow-up period of 5376 patient-weeks, 74% of patients in the standard treatment group had 62 infections, yielding an aggregate infection rate of 1.15 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 1.08; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.44). This rate was comparable to that seen in the plasmapheresis-treated patients who were followed for 4187 patient-weeks: 68% had 51 infections, for an aggregate infection rate of 1.22 infections per 100 weeks (median individual infection rate, 0.94; 25th and 75th percentiles, 0.0 and 2.32). The infection rate was also comparable in the initial acute phase of the study, despite the fact that patients who received plasmapheresis then had significantly lower immunoglobulin (IgG) levels (P less than 0.001). Neither the site (superficial compared with systemic) nor the nature (conventional compared with unconventional) of infection differed statistically between the two groups. Of 14 patient deaths, 7 were from infection (4 in control group and 3 in the plasmapheresis group). CONCLUSION: Plasmapheresis did not increase the risk for infection in immunosuppressed patients with severe lupus nephritis.

AB  - Introduction and Aims: There is no study till date that has compared oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with fixed low-dose intravenous (i.v.) cyclophosphamide (Euro-Lupus Nephritis Treatment, ELNT) regimen in the treatment of less severe, proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). The current study was aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of ELNT regimen with oral MMF in the treatment of such cases. Method(s): This was an open label, prospective, randomized, two-arm study in which the newly diagnosed cases of class III, IV, & V LN were included. Those with crescentic LN, serum creatinine >265.0 mumol/L, neurological or pulmonary lupus, ongoing infection, pregnant females, and prior treatment with CYC or MMF were excluded. The subjects were randomised to receive either fixed low dose i.v. CYC (ELNT regimen) or oral MMF. MMF was given at a dose of 2-3 gm/day in 2 divided doses, while CYC was administered as six fortnightly i.v. infusions of 500 mg each. All subjects also received 3 pulses of i.v. methylprednisolone 750 mg each followed by 1mg/kg/day prednisolone for 8-10 weeks which was tapered slowly. After completion of induction treatment, the patients were started on maintenance treatment with azathioprine (2 mg/kg) along with low-dose steroids. The primary end point was the treatment response (decline in the urine protein/creatinine ratio, uPCR to <3 in those with baseline uPCR >=3 or decline by >=50% if the baseline uPCR was <3 along with either stabilization or improvement of serum creatinine. The secondary end points were a. complete renal remission (defined as normal serum creatinine, proteinuria <=0.5 g/day and inactive urine sediment) b. systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI)] and c. adverse events.All analysis was done in R-Gui, v3.0.1 statistical software onWindow-7 machine. The significance was compared at pre-fixed level of alpha (0.05). Result(s): During the study period, a total of 139 subjects were screened, of which 81 were randomized to receive either i.v. CYC (n=39) or oral MMF (n=42). There was no difference in the baseline characteristics except for uPCR which was significantly higher in the CYC group. At the end of 24 weeks, 81.8% subjects in the CYC group and 80% subjects in the MMF group achieved primary endpoint (p=ns). Similarly, the remission rate was achieved equally in both the groups (51.5% in CYC vs 60% in MMF, p=ns). There was no difference in the SLEDAI score between the two groups. Significantly higher number of subjects in the MMF group as compared to CYC group had gastrointestinal symptoms (50% vs 2.7% respectively, p<0.001). There was however no difference in the incidence or severity of cytopenia, infection rate, severe infection or other adverse event in between the two groups. The monthly cost of oral MMF (103 Euros) was four fold higher to that of the CYC therapy (22 Euros). Conclusion(s): Both the treatment options achieved similar treatment response and remission rates with significantly higher cost and greater incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in the MMF group. Fixed Low dose CYC regimen is a suitable alternative for less severe proliferative LN in our subjects.

AB  - No previous study has compared mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with low-dose cyclophosphamide (CYC) in the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN). To do so, we recruited patients with LN (class III, IV, or V) and randomized them to receive either low-dose CYC or oral MMF. Those with crescentic LN, a serum creatinine over 265 μmol/l, and neurological or pulmonary lupus were excluded. MMF was prescribed at daily doses of 1.5-3 g for 24 weeks, while CYC was administered as six fortnightly infusions of 500 mg each. All patients received three methylprednisolone injections, followed by oral corticosteroids. Maintenance therapy with azathioprine and low-dose corticosteroid was started at end of induction therapy. The primary end point was treatment response at 24 weeks, while secondary end points were complete remission, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index and adverse events. Of the 173 patients recruited, 100 were equally randomized to receive either CYC or MMF. Baseline characteristics were similar, except for higher 24 h proteinuria in the CYC group. At 24 weeks, 37 patients in each group achieved the primary end point. The complete remission rate was 50% in CYC and 54% in MMF group. Gastrointestinal symptoms were significantly more frequent in patients receiving MMF (52 vs. 4%). However, other adverse events were similar. Thus, low-dose intravenous CYC is comparable in safety and efficacy to oral MMF in the induction treatment of less severe LN.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Management of SLE and lupus nephritis is challenging as it is always a trade off between remission, prevention of relapse and long term adverse effects of drugs. No previous trial has compared oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with low dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CYC) as induction agent followed by azathioprine as maintenance agent in the treatment of less severe lupus nephritis (LN). Method(s): This study is a follow-up study of previous open label, ongoing prospective, randomized trial comparing the efficacy and safety of low dose CYC (Euro-lupus regimen) and oral MMF in subjects with class III, IV, V, III+V, or IV+V LN. Subjects with crescentic LN, serum creatinine >3mg/dl, neurological or pulmonary lupus, ongoing infection, pregnancy and prior CYC or MMF use were excluded. The dose of MMF was 2-3 gm/day for 6 months, while CYC was administered as six fortnightly infusions of 500 mg each. All subjects also received three consecutive intravenous methylprednisolone injections initially followed by oral steroids at 1mg/kg up to 2 months and then tapered to a dose of 5-7.5 mg/day. After completion of induction treatment, all subjects were prescribed azathioprine (2 mg/kg) with low dose steroid. Result(s): A total of 100 subjects were randomized, of which 69 completed one year of maintenance treatment with azathioprine after receiving either MMF or CYC as induction agent. Out of these 69 subjects, thirty four (n=34) received CYC and thirty five received MMF (n=35) as an induction agent. Baseline characteristics were similar except for a higher 24 hour protein excretion in the CYC group. Sixty one of total subjects, i.e.88.4%, (n=32 in CYC and n =29 in MMF, p=ns) achieved treatment response, of which fifty seven subjects achieved remission. Mean duration to achieve remission in CYC arm was 21.81 weeks and 19.47 weeks in MMF arm. Eight patients had resistant disease (MMF =6, CYC=2), six deaths (MMF=5, CYC=1), four lost to follow up (MMF=1, CYC=3) and one patient deviated from protocol. Four subjects, 3 in MMF and 1 in CYC arm had nephrotic flare during follow up and none had nephritic flare. Gastrointestinal symptoms were more frequent in the MMF group; however there was no difference in other adverse events. Main adverse events during maintenance phase were cytopenia in one patient, herpes zoster in one and avascular necrosis of femoral head in one patient. The treatment cost of MMF was ten times more than the CYC therapy. Conclusion(s): One year outcome of maintenance phase with azathioprine were similar in low dose intravenous CYC and oral MMF arm in treatment of less severe lupus nephritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial in patients with lupus nephritis treated concomitantly with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids. METHODS: Patients (n = 144) with class III or class IV lupus nephritis were randomized 1:1 to receive rituximab (1,000 mg) or placebo on days 1, 15, 168, and 182. The primary end point was renal response status at week 52. RESULTS: Rituximab depleted peripheral CD19+ B cells in 71 of 72 patients. The overall (complete and partial) renal response rates were 45.8% among the 72 patients receiving placebo and 56.9% among the 72 patients receiving rituximab (P = 0.18); partial responses accounted for most of the difference. The primary end point (superior response rate with rituximab) was not achieved. Eight placebo-treated patients and no rituximab-treated patients required cyclophosphamide rescue therapy through week 52. Statistically significant improvements in serum complement C3, C4, and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) levels were observed among patients treated with rituximab. In both treatment groups, a reduction in anti-dsDNA levels greater than the median reduction was associated with reduced proteinuria. The rates of serious adverse events, including infections, were similar in both groups. Neutropenia, leukopenia, and hypotension occurred more frequently in the rituximab group. CONCLUSION: Although rituximab therapy led to more responders and greater reductions in anti-dsDNA and C3/C4 levels, it did not improve clinical outcomes after 1 year of treatment. The combination of rituximab with MMF and corticosteroids did not result in any new or unexpected safety signals.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sirukumab, an anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of patients with active lupus nephritis (LN). METHODS: Patients with class III or class IV LN (as determined by renal biopsy within 14 months of randomization) who had persistent proteinuria (>0.5 gm/day) despite receiving immunosuppressive therapy and who were being treated with stable doses of a renin-angiotensin system blocker were randomized (5:1) to receive treatment with sirukumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously (n = 21) or placebo (n = 4) every 4 weeks through week 24. The primary end point was the percent reduction in proteinuria (measured as the protein-to-creatinine [P:C] ratio in a 12-hour urine collection) from baseline to week 24. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 19 (76.0%) completed treatment through week 24 and 6 (24.0%) discontinued the study agent early, with 5 of the 6 discontinuing due to adverse events. At week 24, the median percent change in proteinuria from baseline to week 24 in sirukumab-treated patients was 0.0% (95% confidence interval -61.8, 39.6). In contrast, the 4 placebo-treated patients showed an increase in proteinuria (median percent reduction -43.3%) at week 24. Of note, a subset of 5 sirukumab-treated patients had ≥50% improvement in their P:C ratio through week 28. In the sirukumab group, 47.6% of patients experienced ≥1 serious adverse event through week 40; most were infection-related. No deaths or malignancies occurred. No serious adverse events were observed in the 4 placebo-treated patients. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study did not demonstrate the anticipated efficacy nor did it demonstrate an acceptable safety profile for sirukumab treatment in this population of patients with active LN receiving concomitant immunosuppressive treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a severe manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that is usually treated with an extended course of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (CYC). Given the side effects of this regimen, we evaluated the short-term efficacy and toxicity of a course of low-dose remission-inducing IV CYC followed by azathioprine (AZA) in a prospective controlled study among Egyptian patients with severe LN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center, prospective clinical trial, we assigned 46 SLE patients with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis to either a high-dose (a maximum of 1 g/dose) of IV CYC (HD-CYC) for six monthly pulses followed by two quarterly pulses or a fixed low-dose (500 mg/dose) of IV CYC (LD-CYC) for six fortnightly pulses with a cumulative dose of 3 g. Each regimen was followed by AZA. THE OBJECTIVE: To compare between efficacy, potential toxicity and outcome of parenteral LD-CYC versus HD-CYC therapy for severe LN. RESULTS: Twenty patients (2 male and 18 female) received fortnightly fixed LD-CYC while 26 (5 male and 21 female) received monthly HD-CYC therapy. At the end of the study (1 year after starting therapy), there was no difference either in patients' or in renal survival in both groups. Significant improvement of disease activity (SLE disease activity index) as well as rise of serum albumin was noticed with both regimens. Renal relapse was observed in 11.5% of HD-CYC patients and in none of the LD-CYC therapy patients. Treatment failure was seen in 5% and 3.4% (P = NS) of LD-CYC and HD-CYC patients, respectively. Infection (pneumonia and cellulitis) occurred in five patients in the LD-CYC group and four patients of HD-CYC; again this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: A remission-inducing regimen of LD-CYC (cumulative dose 3 g) followed by AZA for SLE patients with proliferative LN achieves clinical results comparable to those obtained with HD-CYC without serious infection in both regimens.

AB  - Background/Purpose: The Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS) demonstrated the efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF-a prodrug of MFA, mycophenolic acid) for both induction and maintenance of response in lupus nephritis. However, response is not uniform and it remains unresolved whether this relates to genetic variation in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH).SNPs in IMPDH1 (rs2278294) and IMPDH2 (rs11706052) confer a higher risk of acute rejection in renal transplant recipients, and lymphocytes of mutant carriers (rs11706052) yieldan antiproliferative effect which is half that of subjects who are homozygous common. In addition, the ability of MMF to reduce pathogenic nitric oxide (NO) is attenuated in subjects carrying variant forms of IMPDH. Accordingly, this study was initiated to determine whether the clinical response of MMF and phenotype (NO levels) in ALMS associates with variants of IMPDH. Method(s): Subjects were 62 ALMS patients randomized to MMF in induction and/or maintenance.DNA and blood samples were obtained for evaluation of genetic variation and serum NO levels (colorimetric method, NO = nitrite + nitrate).Genotyping assignments were made based on a postread of the amplified genomic patient DNA by allelic discrimination and use of probes for IMPDH1 rs2278294 and IMPDH2 rs11706052 (Applied Biosystems).The allele calling rate of 62 DNA samples was 98% for rs2278294 and 100% for rs11706052.Assignments were verified by PCR amplification and direct sequencing.Both rs11706052 (IMPDH2) and rs2278294 (IMPDH1) were tested for departure from Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) expectations. Result(s): Representation of the two candidate SNPs had no HWE deviation; the relatively frequent minor alleles were comparable to those in the dbSNP database and in agreement with allelic discrimination and direct sequencing.Patients were stratified into two groups: Group I defined as responders to MMF at induction and non-treatment failures at maintenance, and Group 2 non-responders at induction and treatment failures at maintenance.For the IMPDH2, rs11706052, the distribution of variant alleles was similar for subjects in both groups (10.5%vs 13.9% MAFfor Groups 1 (N=18) and 2 (N=19), respectively). Similar results were observed when the analysis was restricted to Hispanics (largest ethnic group). For the IMPDH1,rs2278294, no association was observed between groups (44.4%vs 44.7% MAF, Groups 1 vs Groups 2).With regard to NO, there was no association between genotypes at rs2278294 and levels (14.5+/-2.6 uM vs 20.4+/-2.8, P=0.30, homozygous variant (N=9) versus heterozygous + homozygous common (N=33), respectively). Conclusion(s): In distinction to renal transplant, genetic variation at IMPDH1 and IMPDH2 does not account for variability in the clinical response to MMF or levels of NO. These results should allay concerns regarding genetic testing of these alleles to predict efficacy of MMF in lupus.

AB  - We carried out a prospective randomized trial comparing pulse cyclophosphamide and pulse methylprednisolone in 29 patients with severe lupus nephritis in activity. Patients were assigned to one of two regimens: monthly pulse cyclophosphamide (0.5-1.0 g/m2 body surface area) for 4 months, followed by bimonthly doses for 4 months and quarterly doses for 6 months (14 patients) or pulse methylprednisolone (10-20 mg/kg weight) initially for 3 consecutive days and thereafter in the same intervals as the alternative regimen (15 patients). The mean follow-up was 15 months. Two patients in the cyclophosphamide group and three in the methylprednisolone group died. Renal failure (doubling of serum creatinine) developed in four patients in the cyclophosphamide group compared with five patients in the methylprednisolone group. Cumulative probability of not doubling serum creatinine was similar for cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone groups (0.66 vs 0.69, respectively, P > 0.20, after 18 months). Cumulative probability of survival without renal failure was also not significantly different (0.61 and 0.63, respectively, P > 0.20, after 18 months). These results suggest that pulse cyclophosphamide is as effective as pulse methylprednisolone in preserving renal function in patients with severe lupus nephritis.

AB  - The Phase III Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS) will investigate mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy for lupus nephritis (LN). Eligibility criteria include: 12-75 years of age; diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus according to revised American College of Rheumatology criteria; and biopsy-demonstrated LN (Class III-V). Randomized patients will receive open-label induction therapy with MMF or cyclophosphamide in combination with corticosteroids for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint is treatment response [decreased proteinuria and stabilized (within 25% of baseline) or improved serum creatinine level]. Patients achieving response or complete remission (normalization of all parameters) will be rerandomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled maintenance treatment with MMF or azathioprine, both plus corticosteroids. The maintenance phase primary endpoint is time to treatment failure. To detect a 15% rate improvement in the MMF group compared with cyclophosphamide, and to provide 90% power, a total of 358 patients will be required for the induction phase. On the basis of a projected 278 rerandomized patients, the maintenance phase will have 90% power to detect a difference between treatment groups assuming azathioprine and MMF three-year failure rates of 59.5% and 40.7%, respectively. Aspreva Lupus Management Study may provide invaluable comparative data on the efficacy and safety of MMF as LN induction and maintenance therapy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess long-term preservation of renal function in 111 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and active glomerulonephritis who participated in a randomized treatment trial. Four different drug treatment programs, each of which allowed the use of low-dose oral prednisone in addition to the study drug(s), were compared with a regimen consisting solely of high-dose oral prednisone. Patients randomized to receive intravenous cyclophosphamide, oral cyclophosphamide, or oral azathioprine plus cyclophosphamide had significantly better preservation of renal function than did patients who were randomized to receive prednisone only. Results in the azathioprine group did not differ from those in the prednisone-only group. Cyclophosphamide appears to have long-term benefit in the delay or prevention of end-stage renal disease in patients with lupus nephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial, azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were compared as maintenance immunosuppressive treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis (LN) after a short-course of intravenous cyclophosphamide. Here, we compare the pathological findings on repeat kidney biopsies between the two groups. METHODS: Per protocol, repeat renal biopsies were obtained in 30 patients (16 AZA and 14 MMF) at 2 years (±6 months). Baseline and follow-up biopsies were graded according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathological Society (ISN/RPS) classification. The activity and chronicity indices (AI, CI) were calculated using two different semiquantitative scoring systems (Morel-Maroger and National Institutes of Health). Statistics were performed by non-parametric tests. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of the 30 re-biopsied patients only marginally differ from the entire MAINTAIN cohort (105 patients). Clinical baseline and follow-up characteristics of AZA- and MMF-treated re-biopsied patients did not differ. Time (SD) to repeat renal biopsy was 25.0 (2.0) and 26.5 (3.3) months in AZA and MMF patients, respectively. More patients had normal renal biopsies or Classes I/II/V LN at follow-up compared to baseline and conversely, less patients had Class IV LN at follow-up. In both groups, the AI statistically decreased at follow-up compared to baseline, while the CI slightly, but significantly, increased. No differences could be detected between the groups. CONCLUSION: Centralized pathological analyses, including ISN/RPS classification and comparisons of AI/CI, failed to find differences between MMF and AZA at 2 years, a result well in line with the absence of difference in long-term clinical outcome reported elsewhere.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination of cyclophosphamide (CTX) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as induction treatment in Chinese patients with class IV lupus nephritis (LN). 82 patients were randomly divided into control (CTX, n=40) and test (CTX+MMF, n=42) groups, and they received monthly dose of 0.75 g/m(2) of body surface area of CTX and monthly dose of 0.4 g/m(2) CTX plus 1.0 g/d MMF, respectively. Patients were followed up for six months after treatment; and their efficacy rates, complete remission rates, adverse events, and certain indices in blood were compared between the two groups. Compared with the baseline levels, significant differences in the levels of hemoglobin, urinary proteins, albumin, serum creatinine, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, complement C3 and anti-dsDNA were observed after treatment in both groups (P<0.05). While the two groups did not differ significantly after treatment (P>0.05). There was a trend toward higher complete remission (54.8%) and efficacy rates (88.1%) after treatment in the test group without statistical significance. However, the incidence rate of gastrointestinal reactions (7.1%) and infections (11.9%) in the test group were significantly lower than the control group (P<0.05). The efficacy of lower dose of CTX combined with MMF as induction therapy for LN was not lower than the traditional treatment with CTX. Moreover, the low dose of CTX in combination with MMF could result in lesser adverse events and improved safety.

AB  - The safety and efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were evaluated in adolescent patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and active or active/chronic class III-V lupus nephritis. During the 24-week induction phase, patients were randomized to oral MMF (target dose 3.0 g/day) or intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) (0.5-1.0 g/m(2)/month), plus prednisone. Response was defined as a decrease in 24-hour urine protein:creatinine ratio (P:Cr) to < 3 in patients with baseline nephrotic range proteinuria, or by ≥ 50% if subnephrotic baseline proteinuria, and stabilization (± 25%) or improvement in serum creatinine. In the 36-month maintenance phase, induction therapy responders were randomized 1:1 to MMF (1.0 g twice daily) or oral azathioprine (AZA) (2 mg/kg/day), plus prednisone. In the induction phase, 10 patients received MMF and 14 received IVC; 15 (62.5%) achieved treatment response (MMF, 7 (70%); IVC, 8/15 (57.1%); p = 0.53, odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.0 (0.2, 15.5)). There was a non-statistically significant difference in maintenance of response to MMF (7/8; 87.5%) versus AZA (3/8; 37.5%). Seven patients withdrew (MMF, 2; AZA, 5). During both phases, rates of serious adverse events were similar in both arms. During both phases treatment response with MMF was as effective as the comparator.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report the 10-year follow-up of the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial comparing azathioprine (AZA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as maintenance therapy of proliferative lupus nephritis, and to test different definitions of early response as predictors of long-term renal outcome. METHODS: In 2014, data on survival, kidney function, 24 h proteinuria, renal flares and other outcomes were collected for the 105 patients randomised between 2002 and 2006, except in 13 lost to follow-up. RESULTS: Death (2 and 3 in the AZA and MMF groups, respectively) and end-stage renal disease (1 and 3, respectively) were rare events. Time to renal flare (22 and 19 flares in AZA and MMF groups, respectively) did not differ between AZA and MMF patients. Patients with good long-term renal outcome had a much more stringent early decrease of 24 h proteinuria compared with patients with poor outcome. The positive predictive value of a 24 h proteinuria <0.5 g/day at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months for a good long-term renal outcome was excellent (between 89% and 92%). Inclusion of renal function and urinalysis in the early response criteria did not impact the value of early proteinuria decrease as long-term prognostic marker. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term follow-up data of the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial do not indicate that MMF is superior to AZA as maintenance therapy in a Caucasian population suffering from proliferative lupus nephritis. Moreover, we confirm the excellent positive predictive value of an early proteinuria decrease for long-term renal outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00204022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although an early decrease in proteinuria has been correlated with good long-term renal outcome in lupus nephritis (LN), studies aimed at defining a cut-off proteinuria value are missing, except a recent analysis performed on patients randomised in the Euro-Lupus Nephritis Trial, demonstrating that a target value of 0.8 g/day at month 12 optimised sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of good renal outcome. The objective of the current work is to validate this target in another LN study, namely the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trial (MNT). METHODS: Long-term (at least 7 years) renal function data were available for 90 patients randomised in the MNT. Receiver operating characteristic curves were built to test the performance of proteinuria measured within the 1st year as short-term predictor of long-term renal outcome. We calculated the positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV). RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, achievement of a proteinuria <0.7 g/day best predicted good renal outcome, with a sensitivity and a specificity of 71% and 75%, respectively. The PPV was high (94%) but the NPV low (29%). Addition of the requirement of urine red blood cells ≤5/hpf as response criteria at month 12 reduced sensitivity from 71% to 41%. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of mainly Caucasian patients suffering from a first episode of LN in most cases, achievement of a proteinuria <0.7 g/day at month 12 best predicts good outcome at 7 years and inclusion of haematuria in the set of criteria at month 12 undermines the sensitivity of early proteinuria decrease for the prediction of good outcome. The robustness of these conclusions stems from the very similar results obtained in two distinct LN cohorts. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00204022.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cyclophosphamide, in combination with corticosteroids, has been first-line treatment for inducing disease remission for proliferative lupus nephritis, reducing death at five years from over 50% in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 10% in recent years. Several treatment strategies designed to improve remission rates and minimise toxicity have become available. Treatments, including mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and calcineurin inhibitors, alone and in combination, may have equivalent or improved rates of remission, lower toxicity (less alopecia and ovarian failure) and uncertain effects on death, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and infection. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004 and updated in 2012. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to assess the evidence and evaluate the benefits and harms of different immunosuppressive treatments in people with biopsy-proven lupus nephritis. The following questions relating to management of proliferative lupus nephritis were addressed: 1) Are new immunosuppressive agents superior to or as effective as cyclophosphamide plus corticosteroids? 2) Which agents, dosages, routes of administration and duration of therapy should be used? 3) Which toxicities occur with the different treatment regimens? SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialised Register up to 2 March 2018 with support from the Cochrane Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Specialised Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing any immunosuppressive treatment for biopsy-proven class III, IV, V+III and V+VI lupus nephritis in adult or paediatric patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were abstracted and the risks of bias were assessed independently by two authors. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated as risk ratio (RR) and measures on continuous scales calculated as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The primary outcomes were death (all causes) and complete disease remission for induction therapy and disease relapse for maintenance therapy. Evidence certainty was determined using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: In this review update, 26 new studies were identified, to include 74 studies involving 5175 participants overall. Twenty-nine studies included children under the age of 18 years with lupus nephritis, however only two studies exclusively examined the treatment of lupus nephritis in patients less than 18 years of age.Induction therapy Sixty-seven studies (4791 participants; median 12 months duration (range 2.5 to 48 months)) reported induction therapy. The effects of all treatment strategies on death (all causes) and ESKD were uncertain (very low certainty evidence) as this outcome occurred very infrequently. Compared with intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, MMF may have increased complete disease remission (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.42; low certainty evidence), although the range of effects includes the possibility of little or no difference.Compared to IV cyclophosphamide, MMF is probably associated with decreased alopecia (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.46; 170 less (129 less to 194 less) per 1000 people) (moderate certainty evidence), increased diarrhoea (RR 2.42, 95% CI 1.64 to 3.58; 142 more (64 more to 257 more) per 1000 people) (moderate certainty evidence) and may have made little or no difference to major infection (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.54; 2 less (38 less to 62 more) per 1000 people) (low certainty evidence). It is uncertain if MMF decreased ovarian failure compared to IV cyclophosphamide because the certainty of the evidence was very low (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.18; 26 less (39 less to 49 more) per 1000 people). Studies were not generally designed to measure ESKD.MMF combined with tacrolimus may have increased complete disease remission (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.30; 336 more (17 to 1048 more) per 1000 people (low certainty evidence) compared with IV cyclophosphamide, however the effects on alopecia, diarrhoea, ovarian failure, and major infection remain uncertain. Compared to standard of care, the effects of biologics on most outcomes were uncertain because of low to very low certainty of evidence.Maintenance therapyNine studies (767 participants; median 30 months duration (range 6 to 63 months)) reported maintenance therapy. In maintenance therapy, disease relapse is probably increased with azathioprine compared with MMF (RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.55; 114 more (30 to 236 more) per 1000 people (moderate certainty evidence). Multiple other interventions were compared as maintenance therapy, but patient-outcome data were sparse leading to imprecise estimates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In this review update, studies assessing treatment for proliferative lupus nephritis were not designed to assess death (all causes) or ESKD. MMF may lead to increased complete disease remission compared with IV cyclophosphamide, with an acceptable adverse event profile, although evidence certainty was low and included the possibility of no difference. Calcineurin combined with lower dose MMF may improve induction of disease remission compared with IV cyclophosphamide, but the comparative safety profile of these therapies is uncertain. Azathioprine may increase disease relapse as maintenance therapy compared with MMF.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of pulse/synchronization cyclophosphamide/apheresis in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis. METHODS: Eighteen patients with Class III or IV renal biopsies and chronicity indices <6 were prospectively randomized to receive 6 courses of parenteral cyclophosphamide over 8 months along with prednisone. Nine of these patients also received 3 daily plasmaphereses prior to each of the 6 courses of cyclophosphamide. Assessments compiled at 6 and 24 months included serum creatinine, albumin, anti DNA, 24-hour urine protein, and C3 complement along with SLAM scores. RESULTS: Two out of nine patients in each group evolved end stage renal disease and 3/9 patients in each group went into a renal remission at 24 months. Serum albumin, C3 complement, and SLAM scores improved in both groups, and anti-DNA improved in the pulse/synchronization patients (P < 0.025). No intergroup comparisons were significant. CONCLUSION: The addition of pulse/synchronization apheresis to cyclophosphamide therapy does not improve the course of patients with proliferative lupus nephritis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) frequently is used as an alternative to intravenous cyclophosphamide to treat lupus nephritis. Whether MMF is adequate for patients with severely decreased kidney function at the time of treatment is uncertain. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) from a large trial of MMF compared to cyclophosphamide in lupus nephritis. SETTINGS & PARTICIPANTS: We included all patients with an eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) from the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS). INTERVENTION: MMF (target, 3 g/d) compared to monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide (0.5-1 g/m(2)). OUTCOMES: We compared the proportion of patients that responded to therapy and change in eGFR over 24 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: Response was evaluated by a decrease in proteinuria and stabilization or improvement of serum creatinine level. RESULTS: Of 370 patients in ALMS, 32 were included in the subgroup analysis: 20 randomly assigned to MMF and 12 randomly assigned to cyclophosphamide treatment. The patients included were similar at baseline between groups. Four (20.0%) patients treated with MMF responded compared with 2 (16.7%) patients treated with cyclophosphamide (risk ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.3-5.1; P = 0.9). eGFR in the MMF group improved more quickly than in the cyclophosphamide group, by 1.51 (95% CI, 0.99-2.02) mL/min/1.73 m(2) each week (P < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 9 (45.0%) MMF-treated patients and 7 (63.6%) cyclophosphamide-treated patients (P = 0.5). LIMITATIONS: Small sample size and post hoc subgroup of a larger trial. CONCLUSIONS: We did not detect a difference in the primary outcome of response in patients with low eGFR treated with MMF or cyclophosphamide. However, MMF may result in quicker recovery of kidney function compared with those treated with cyclophosphamide. Larger studies including more patients with poor kidney function are warranted.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Studies in murine models for SLE have shown that CTLA4Ig can ameliorate murine lupus nephritis. Moreover, the combination of CTLA4Ig plus intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVC) acts synergistically in mice to reverse lupus nephritis. The purpose of this study (the ACCESS Trial) was to determine whether these observations in mice could be translated into an effective treatment for lupus nephritis in people. Method(s): Subjects with biopsy-proven class III or IV lupus nephritis (with or without class V) and urine protein:creatinine ratio (UPCR) >1 were enrolled in the trial. All subjects received low-dose IVC (500 mg q 2 wks x 6) followed by azathioprine (2 mg/kg/d up to a maximum of 200 mg/dose), per the Euro-Lupus nephritis (ELN) regimen. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either saline (n=68) or abatacept (ABA) (n=66) intravenously at weeks 0, 2, 4, and then every four weeks. ABA was dosed based on weight: <60 kg, 500 mg; 60-100 kg, 750 mg; >100 kg, 1 gm. In addition, subjects received oral prednisone beginning at 60 mg/d and tapered to 10 mg/d within 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure was complete response (CR) at 24 weeks, defined as: (i) UPCR <0.5; (ii) serum creatinine normal or, if abnormal, within 25% of baseline; and (iii) adherence to the steroid regimen. Partial response required a >50% improvement in UPCR and otherwise mirrored the CR criteria. Result(s): A racially and ethnically diverse population of North American subjects was enrolled (39% African American and 40% Hispanic/Mestizo). The groups were well matched for baseline characteristics, including race, ethnicity, severity of nephritis, and biopsy class. At 24 weeks, the CR rate in the ABA group was 22/66 (33%) compared to 21/68 (31%) in the control group (p=0.85). Total response (CR+PR) was 59% in both groups (39/66 vs 40/68). Among African American subjects, 33% (9/27) of subjects in the ABA group achieved CR, compared to 16% (4/25) in the control group (p=0.20). Twice as many subjects in the ABA group experienced disappearance of anti-dsDNA Ab (24% vs 11%), but the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.22). Patient global assessment improved by 74% in the ABA group compared to 38% in the control group (p=0.051). There was no difference between the groups at week 24 in mean UPCR, anti-dsDNA and complement levels, BILAG score, SF-36 (physical and mental), frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs), or withdrawals (total or lupus-related). The rate of infectious SAEs was 0.3/yr in the ABA group compared to 0.2/yr in the control group (NS). Conclusion(s): The ACCESS trial did not achieve its primary goal of demonstrating a benefit for ABA plus ELN compared to ELN alone at 24 weeks. However, it achieved an important secondary objective by providing the first systematic examination of the ELN regimen in a racially and ethnically diverse North American population. The response rate of >30% CR within 24 weeks in the ELN control group is higher than has been reported in prior lupus nephritis trials (including studies of mycophenolate mofetil and high-dose IVC), suggesting that the ELN regimen may have broad applicability. Subjects in the ACCESS trial are still undergoing blinded evaluation to examine outcome at later time points.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent clinical trials in lupus nephritis have all used different criteria to assess complete response. The objective of this analysis was to compare several previously proposed criteria, using the same data set from a large trial of abatacept in lupus nephritis (IM101075). In so doing, we sought to determine which criteria are most sensitive to differences among treatment groups and to further examine the potential of abatacept in lupus nephritis. METHODS: Patients in the IM101075 trial received abatacept at 1 of 2 different dose regimens or placebo, both on a background of mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids. Using data from this trial, we assessed rates of complete response at 12 months according to 5 sets of criteria, from 1) the trial protocol, 2) the Aspreva Lupus Management Study (ALMS) trial of mycophenolate mofetil, 3) the Lupus Nephritis Assessment with Rituximab (LUNAR) trial of rituximab, 4) an ongoing National Institutes of Health trial of abatacept (Abatacept and Cyclophosphamide Combination: Efficacy and Safety Study [ACCESS]), and 5) published recommendations of the American College of Rheumatology. RESULTS: According to the complete response definition from the IM101075 study protocol, there was no difference among treatment groups in the IM101075 study. In contrast, according to the ALMS, LUNAR, and ACCESS criteria, rates of complete response among patients in the IM101075 study were higher in both treatment groups relative to control. The largest differences were obtained with use of the LUNAR criteria (complete response rate of 6% in the control group, compared to 22% and 24% in the 2 abatacept groups). CONCLUSION: The choice of definition of complete response can determine whether a lupus nephritis trial is interpreted as a success or a failure. The results of this analysis provide an evidence-based rationale for choosing among alternative definitions and offer a strong rationale for conducting further studies of abatacept in lupus nephritis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials of therapies for lupus nephritis have used many different primary outcome measures, ranging from complete response to time to end-stage renal disease. The objective of this study was to compare several possible outcome measures, using data from a large, multicenter trial of abatacept in lupus nephritis, to gain insight into which outcome measure, if any, was best able to discern differences among treatment groups. METHODS: Study patients received either abatacept or placebo, on a background of mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids. Using data from this trial, the following primary outcome measures at 24 and 52 weeks were compared: complete response rate, major clinical response rate, total response rate (complete plus partial response), improvement in proteinuria, improvement in estimated glomerular filtration rate, and frequency of treatment failure. Time to complete response was also evaluated. RESULTS: Complete response rate, major clinical response rate, and time to complete response were the measures that best discriminated between the abatacept groups and placebo, and the sensitivities of these 3 measures were comparable. For these measures, sample sizes of 50 patients would have been sufficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between treatment and control at 52 weeks. Each of the other measures also discriminated between treatment and control, but much larger group sizes would have been required to determine statistical significance. CONCLUSION: The choice of primary outcome measure can substantially influence the ability to detect therapeutic benefit in lupus nephritis trials. This study suggests that complete response rate, major clinical response rate at 52 weeks, and time to complete response may be the most sensitive outcome measures for detecting differences among therapeutic regimens.

AB  - Background/Purpose: Recent trials of novel therapies for lupus nephritis (LN) have used varying primary endpoints, but there is no consensus about which may be most sensitive to change or most representative of clinical status. We compared the performance of two different outcome measures when applied to the same data set from a double-blind, controlled phase II/III study of abatacept (ABA) in patients with LN (trial IM101075- efficacy and safety reported in a separate abstract). Method(s): In IM101075, 300 subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to one of: 3 mos ABA 30 mg/kg and 9 mos of 10 mg/kg [30/10]; 12 mos ABA10 mg/kg [10/10]; or placebo, administered IV in combination with MMF (target dose 1.5-3.0 gm/d) and corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg/d or equivalent with response-guided taper.) We compared two outcome measures (OM) that have been accepted by the FDA for use in trials of ABA for LN. OM1, from IM101075, is the proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) at Study Day 337 and 365, defined as eGFR within 10% of pre-treatment value, urine prot:creat ratio (UPCR) <30 mg/mmol, and normal urine sediment. In contrast, OM2 as defined in the ongoing ACCESS study (NCT00774852) is the proportion of subjects who reach CR,defined as serum creatinine either normal or <=125% of baseline, UPCR <0.5 g/g, and prednisone dose <=10 mg/d at Study Day 365; urine sediment is not a component of OM2. In 24 subjects from IM101075, renal disease was too mild at entry (UPCR <1 g/g) to apply the OM2 criteria; therefore, these subjects were excluded from the analysis of OM2. Result(s): The analysis of OM1 in study IM101075 showed few CRs overall and no difference among the groups (Table). In contrast, OM2 yielded a much higher CR rate and significant differences among groups. The results with OM2 were most striking in patients who were nephrotic at baseline (UPCR >339 mg/mmol). (Table presented) Conclusion(s): These findings demonstrate the importance of the choice of outcome measure for LN trials, and they strongly suggest that OM2 is more sensitive to differences between groups. The ability of either measure to predict long-term outcome remains to be determined. These findings have implications for the interpretation of the IM101075 study from which the data were drawn, supporting further evaluation of the efficacy ABA+MMF in patients with LN.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Cyclophosphamide (CYC) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) are standard induction treatments for active lupus nephritis (LN). CYC induction might be associated with more sustained response compared with MMF. Lymphocyte subsets have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LN, but the impact of CYC and MMF treatment has not been investigated. METHOD(S): Lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokine levels were determined using flow cytometry and ELISAs respectively in 14 patients with active LN randomized to receive either CYC or MMF (n=7 in each group), combined with prednisolone, as induction immunosuppression. RESULT(S): At 24-week after starting induction immunosuppression, CYC treated patients showed a higher percentage of circulating CD8+ cytotoxic T cells compared with the MMF group (47.6+/-10.9% vs. 20.3+/-3.8%, p=0.015). CYC treated patients also had a numerically lower percentage of Th1 cells (1.6+/-1.2% vs. 6.9+/-4.0%, p=0.094) and a higher percentage of regulatory T cells (3.0+/-2.2% vs 1.9+/-2.0%, p=0.534). The percentages of circulating naive B, memory B and plasma cells were similar in the two groups. The percentage of circulating memory B cells correlated with anti-dsDNA antibody level in both groups (r=0.964, p=0.036 for the CYC group and r=0.951, p=0.049 for the MMF groups respectively). CYC treated patients had lower serum IFN-gamma level (83.6+/-136.9 pg/mL vs. 453.1+/-349.1 pg/mL, p=0.032), whereas serum IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IL-21, IL-23, BAFF, IFN-alpha and MCP-1 levels were similar in both groups. CONCLUSION(S): Induction immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and CYC or MMF resulted in differences in lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokine profile in LN patients, which might have clinical implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and side effects of intermittent pulse cyclophosphamide plus methylprednisolone with continuous oral cyclophosphamide plus prednisolone, followed by azathioprine, in patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A multicentre randomised controlled trial was conducted between June 1992 and May 1996 involving eight European centres. All patients satisfied the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SLE and had biopsy proven proliferative lupus nephritis. All received corticosteroids in addition to cytotoxic drugs, as defined in the protocol, for two years. The trial was terminated after four years as recruitment was disappointing. RESULTS: 32 SLE patients with lupus nephritis were recruited: 16 were randomised to intermittent pulse cyclophosphamide and 16 to continuous cyclophosphamide plus azathioprine. Mean duration of follow up was 3.7 years in the continuous group (range 0 to 5.6) and 3.3 years in the pulse group (range 0.25 to 6). Three patients were excluded from the pulse therapy group as they were later found to have pure mesangial glomerulonephritis. Two patients in the continuous therapy group developed end stage renal failure requiring dialysis, but none in the intermittent pulse therapy (p = 0.488; NS). There were similar numbers of side effects and withdrawals from treatment in both groups. There were three deaths: two in the intermittent pulse therapy group and one in the continuous therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant difference in efficacy and side effects between the two regimens. Infectious complications occurred commonly, so careful monitoring is required during treatment.

AB  - Background/Purpose: In the investigator-initiated CYLOFA-LUNE trial we tested the hypothesis that immunosuppressive regimen based on Cyclosporine A (CYA) may have similar efficacy but greater safety than that based on cyclophosphamide (CPH). CYCLOFA-LUNE TRIAL a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled trial conducted from January 2002 through December 2006 in 7 centers in Czech Republic and one center in Slovakia Eligibility criteria: * The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (by meeting 4 criteria of the American College of Rheumatology) * Renal biopsy documenting proliferative glomerulonephritis class III or IV according to WHO/ISN-RPS * Clinical activity as defined by presence of at least two of the following: abnormal proteinuria (> 500mg/24-hours), active urinary sediment, and/or C3 hypocomplementemia Treatment: The duration of the controlled study protocol was 18 months Cyclophosphamide (CPH) arm: 8 boluses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (10mg/kg) given within 9 months in subsequently prolonged intervals (2x3weeks, 4x4 weeks, 2x6 weeks) followed by 4-5 oral cyclophosphamide boluses (10mg/d in 6-8 week intervals). Cyclosporine arm: oral cyclosporine A (CyA) 4-5mg/kg/day (given in two divided doses) for 9 months followed by gradually decreasing dose of cyclosporine (3.75-1.25 mg/kg/day) within the next 9 months Glucocorticoids: prescribed according to a unified protocol The main purpose of the current analysis was to ascertain the long-term renal outcome of patients randomised in the CYCLOFA-LUNE trial. Method(s): Data for kidney function, and adverse events (death, cardiovascular event, tumor, premature menopause) were collected by a cross- sectional suvey for 38 of 40 patients initially randomised in the CYCLOFALUNE trial. Result(s): The median follow-up time was 7.7 years (range 5.0-10.3). Rates of renal impairment and end-stage renal disease, adverse events (death, cardiovascular event, tumor, premature menopause) did not differ between the CPH and CyA group, nor did mean serum creatinine, 24 h proteinuria and SLICC damage score at last follow-up. Most patients in both groups were still treated with glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressant agents, and blood pressure lowering drugs. Conclusion(s): Both regimens based either on CPH or CyA achieved good and similar clinical results in the very long term (Table Presented).

AB  - Intravenous cyclophosphamide is considered to be the standard of care for the treatment of proliferative lupus nephritis. However, its use is limited by potentially severe toxic effects. Cyclosporine A has been suggested to be an efficient and safe treatment alternative to cyclophosphamide. Forty patients with clinically active proliferative lupus nephritis were randomly assigned to one of two sequential induction and maintenance treatment regimens based either on cyclophosphamide or Cyclosporine A. The primary outcomes were remission (defined as normal urinary sediment, proteinuria <0.3 g/24 h, and stable s-creatinine) and response to therapy (defined as stable s-creatinine, 50% reduction in proteinuria, and either normalization of urinary sediment or significant improvement in C3) at the end of induction and maintenance phase. Secondary outcomes were incidence of adverse events, and relapse-free survival. At the end of the induction phase, 24% of the 21 patients treated by cyclophosphamide achieved remission, and 52% achieved response, as compared with 26% and 43%, respectively of the 19 patients treated by the Cyclosporine A. At the end of the maintenance phase, 14% of patients in cyclophosphamide group, and 37% in Cyclosporine A group had remission, and 38% and 58% respectively response. Treatment with Cyclosporine A was associated with transient increase in blood pressure and reversible decrease in glomerular filtration rate. There was no significant difference in median relapse-free survival. In conclusion, Cyclosporine A was as effective as cyclophosphamide in the trial of sequential induction and maintenance treatment in patients with proliferative lupus nephritis and preserved renal function.(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00976300)

AB  - Objective To evaluate the extended follow-up of the CYCLOFA-LUNE trial, a randomized prospective trial comparing two sequential induction and maintenance treatment regimens for proliferative lupus nephritis based either on cyclophosphamide (CPH) or cyclosporine A (CyA). Patients and methods Data for kidney function and adverse events were collected by a cross-sectional survey for 38 of 40 patients initially randomized in the CYCLOFA-LUNE trial. Results The median follow-up time was 7.7 years (range 5.0-10.3). Rates of renal impairment and end-stage renal disease, adverse events (death, cardiovascular event, tumor, premature menopause) did not differ between the CPH and CyA group, nor did mean serum creatinine, 24 h proteinuria and SLICC damage score at last follow-up. Most patients in both groups were still treated with glucocorticoids, other immunosuppressant agents and blood pressure lowering drugs. Conclusion An immunosuppressive regimen based on CyA achieved similar clinical results to that based on CPH in the very long term.

AB  - Mycophenolic acid, in combination with glucocorticoids, has been shown in a series of trials to be safe and effective for treatment of lupus nephritis. Regimens that permit glucocorticoid dose reduction without loss of efficacy would be advantageous. MyLupus was a 24-week, multicentre, open-label, study in patients with active proliferative lupus nephritis treated with enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS), randomized to standard-dose (n = 42) or reduced-dose (n = 39) glucocorticoids. Complete response at week 24, the primary endpoint, was achieved in 19.8% (16/81) of patients (19.0% standard-dose, 20.5% reduced-dose; lower limit of 97.5% CI for the difference -15.9%, p = 0.098, i.e. non-inferiority was not shown). Partial response occurred in 42.0% of patients (34/81). From baseline to week 24, the mean global British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) score decreased from 14.0 ± 5.4 to 5.0 ± 3.8 (p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was 80.2% (65/81), most frequently gastrointestinal complications (31/81, 38.3%). Infections were reported in 57.1% and 35.9% of standard- and reduced-dose glucocorticoid patients, respectively (p = 0.056), with herpes zoster in 16.7% and 0% (p = 0.012). Three patients discontinued study medication due to adverse events. This exploratory study suggests that EC-MPS may facilitate glucocorticoid reduction without loss of efficacy in patients with active lupus nephritis, but results require confirmation in a controlled, longer-term study versus the current standard of care.
