AB  - Background: The fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation is a genetic alteration found in approximately 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although patients with FLT3-ITD AML achieve remission rates similar to those with FLT3 wildtype status with induction chemotherapy regimens; patients with FLT3-ITD have significantly shorter remission durations and increased rates of relapse. Even though allogeneic SCT improves outcomes, patients still have higher rates of relapse comparatively with poor prognosis post relapse. Sorafenib(SFB) is a TKI with activity against RAF, VEGF and FLT3-ITD and its use as maintenance therapy after allogeneic SCT has been shown as a promising approach to decrease relapse. Several studies report that SFB maintenance post SCT provides durable complete responses; however, there are also descriptions of sorafenib post SCT triggering acute GVHD, cytopenias, rash and diarrhea. Aim(s): To assess the outcomes, including progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), in patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML who receive SFB maintenance after allogeneic SCT. Method(s): We analyzed adult patients (age>=18) with a diagnosis of FLT3-ITD mutated AML who received an allogeneic SCT between 1/1/2010 and 10/28/16 at our institution. Using a case control analysis and matching patients who received maintenance SFB (maintenance group) with control patients, FLT3-ITD mutated AML who did not receive maintenance post SCT(control group); we matched each case to two control patients accounting for disease status, type of conditioning, donor type, cytogenetic risk factors and age. To be considered as maintenance, SFB had to be started within 101 days of the SCT. To reduce bias from disease risks and transplant-related mortality (TRM), all patients were required to be in complete remission (CR) at study entry-defined as the date of SFB initiation for cases and the same time point after SCT for their matched controls without maintenance. Actuarial OS and PFS were estimated from study entry using Kaplan-Meier method. OS and PFS were compared between cases and controls using log rank test and cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Patient-, transplant-and disease characteristics were compared between cases and controls using chi square and Fisher exact tests. Result(s): Among the 214 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation that underwent SCT during study period, we identified 13 cases (maintenance) and 26 controls (no maintenance). Median follow-up of survivors were 12 months and 30 months for maintenance and control group respectively. Disease and transplant characteristics were comparable between groups as presented in Figure 1. Patients were classified by the European Leukemia Net (ELN) classification and 23% in both groups were categorized as adverse risk while 77% were intermediate risk. All patients received myeloablative conditioning and diseases status at SCT was first/second complete remission (CR1/2) with or without count recovery (Cri/p) in 69% while it was active disease in 31%. PFS at 24 months post SCT was 82% in the maintenance and 45% in control group HR 0.3; 95% CI (0.1-1.3) p=0.1. Overall survival at 24 months was also higher in SFB cases as 100% compared with 60% in control group p=0.035. Only, 2 patients relapsed post SCT on SFB maintenance, one with new TP53 mutation at relapse, and other received only <30 days of SFB. However, more than half the patients had disease progression within the control period. The most commonly administered dose was 400 mg daily (5 patients) for 28 days cycle; only 2 patients tolerated higher doses and 6 patients received SBF as 300mg daily or less. There were delays in subsequent cycles in 10 of 12 patients, and the most common reasons for delays included cytopenias, liver function test abnormalities, and fatigue. (Figure Presented) Summary/Conclusions: Sorafenib maintenance is safe and can produce long term durable remissions after allogeneic stem cell transplant in a high risk population with FLT3-ITD mutated AML.

AB  - AML with FLT3 ITD mutations are associated with poor outcome. We reviewed outcomes of patients with FLT3 ITD mutated AML to investigate trends over time. We analyzed 224 AML patients (excluding patients with core binding factor and acute promyelocytic leukemia) referred to our institution between 2000 and 2014. Patients were divided into five cohorts by era: 2000-2002 (Era 1, n = 19), 2003-2005 (Era 2, n = 41), 2006-2008 (Era 3, n = 53), 2009-2011 (Era 4, n = 55), and 2012-2014 (Era 5, n = 56) to analyze differences in outcome. The baseline characteristics were not statistically different across Eras. The response rate (CR/CRp) from Era 1-5 was 68%, 49%, 72%, 73%, and 75%, respectively. The overall response rate (all Eras) with chemotherapy alone versus chemotherapy plus FLT3 inhibitor was 67% and 72.5%, respectively (P = 0.4). The median time to relapse was 6, 3.6, 7.9, 8.1 months and not reached from Eras 1 through 5, respectively (P = 0.001). The median OS has improved: 9.6, 7.6, 14.4, 15.7, and 17.8 month from Eras 1-5, respectively (P = <0.001). Stem cell transplant as a time-dependent variable, showed better OS in the univariate analysis (HR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.39-0.84, P = 0.004) but did not retained its significance in multivariate analysis (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.50-1.13, P = 0.16). Our data suggest improvement in outcome of FLT3 ITD mutated AML patients over the last 15 years. This is probably due to improvement in treatment strategies, including but not limited to integration of FLT3 inhibitors and increased use of SCT.

AB  - The addition of midostaurin, a FLT3-inhibitor, to intensive chemotherapy (IC) was previously shown to improve outcome of younger patients with FLT3-mutated AML. The toxicity and efficacy of adding midostaurin to IC in patients not originally included in the RATIFY study or with intensified daunorubicin dosing are unknown. We conducted a retrospective, multi-center, historical-control study to characterize the safety and efficacy of adding midostaurin to IC in a "real-world" setting. Sixty-nine adult patients were included in the analysis (midostaurin n = 34, historical controls n = 35) with a mean follow-up of 18.4 (± 15) months. Median age of patients was 60 (range 26-82) years; 32% and 20% of patients were > 65 and 70 years, respectively. No differences in baseline characteristics were noted between the groups. Midostaurin was administered with 90 mg/m(2) daunorubicin in 29% of patients; One-third of patients experienced dose reductions/interruptions during midostaurin therapy. Overall toxicity was comparable between the midostaurin and control groups.CR/CRi rates were higher in patients treated with midostaurin compared with controls (80% vs. 57%, p = 0.047) and significantly more patients in the midostaurin group were transplanted in first remission (95% vs. 68%, p = 0.04).Median OS and DFS were higher in the midostaurin vs. control group (not reached vs. 11 months (p = 0.085) and 13 vs. 6 months (p = 0.09), respectively). In our analysis, midostaurin was not associated with increased toxicity including in older patients, in those with secondary AML or when administered with intensified daunorubicin dosage. Higher remission rates in the midostaurin group and increased transplantation rates in first CR were associated with a trend towards better outcomes.

AB  - We performed a retrospective study analysing the effect of sorafenib, an oral fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3 (FLT3)/multikinase inhibitor, as post-transplant maintenance in adult patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We identified consecutive patients with FLT3-ITD AML diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 who received haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission (CR1). Post-HCT initiation of sorafenib (yes/no) was evaluated as a time-varying covariate in the overall survival/progression-free survival (OS/PFS) analysis and we performed a landmark analysis of controls alive without relapse at the median date of sorafenib initiation. We identified 26 sorafenib patients and 55 controls. Median follow-up was 27·2 months post-HCT for sorafenib survivors, and 38·4 months for controls (P = 0·021). The median time to initiating sorafenib was 68 days post-HCT; 43 controls were alive without relapse at this cut-off. Sorafenib patients had improved 2-year OS in the d+68 landmark analysis (81% vs. 62%, P = 0·029). Sorafenib was associated with improved 2-year PFS (82% vs. 53%, P = 0·0081) and lower 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (8·2% vs. 37·7%, P = 0·0077). In multivariate analysis, sorafenib significantly improved OS [Hazard ratio (HR) 0·26, P = 0·021] and PFS (HR 0·25, P = 0·016). There was no difference in 2-year non-relapse mortality (9·8% vs. 9·3%, P = 0·82) or 1-year chronic graft-versus-host disease (55·5% vs. 37·2%, P = 0·28). These findings suggest potential benefit of post-HCT sorafenib in FLT3-ITD AML, and support further evaluation of post-HCT FLT3 inhibition.

AB  - PURPOSE: Despite undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with internal tandem duplication mutation in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3-ITD) have a poor prognosis, frequently relapse, and die as a result of AML. It is currently unknown whether a maintenance therapy using FLT3 inhibitors, such as the multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, improves outcome after HCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II trial (SORMAIN; German Clinical Trials Register: DRKS00000591), 83 adult patients with FLT3-ITD-positive AML in complete hematologic remission after HCT were randomly assigned to receive for 24 months either the multitargeted and FLT3-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (n = 43) or placebo (n = 40 placebo). Relapse-free survival (RFS) was the primary endpoint of this trial. Relapse was defined as relapse or death, whatever occurred first. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 41.8 months, the hazard ratio (HR) for relapse or death in the sorafenib group versus placebo group was 0.39 (95% CI, 0.18 to 0.85; log-rank P = .013). The 24-month RFS probability was 53.3% (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.68) with placebo versus 85.0% (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.93) with sorafenib (HR, 0.256; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.65; log-rank P = .002). Exploratory data show that patients with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD) before HCT and those with detectable MRD after HCT derive the strongest benefit from sorafenib. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib maintenance therapy reduces the risk of relapse and death after HCT for FLT3-ITD-positive AML.

AB  - This retrospective analysis compared anthracyclines (as part of an induction regimen) in 128 newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD-mutated AML patients. Induction regimens comprised high-dose daunorubicin (HD-DN; 90 mg/m(2)/d × 3d; n = 44), standard-dose daunorubicin (SD-DN; 45 mg/m(2)/d × 3d; n = 51), or idarubicin (IDA; 12 mg/m(2)/d × 3d; n = 33) in combination with cytarabine (100-200 mg/m(2)/d × 7d). Fifty-three patients showing persistent leukemia on interim bone marrow examination received a second course of induction chemotherapy comprising 2 days of daunorubicin (45 mg/m(2)/d) or IDA (8 or 12 mg/m(2)/d) in addition to 5 days of cytarabine. Complete remission (CR) rates were 77.3%, 56.9%, and 69.7% for HD-DN, SD-DN, and IDA, respectively (P = 0.101; HD-DN vs. SD-DN, P = 0.036; HD-DN vs. IDA, P = 0.453; IDA vs. SD-DN, P = 0.237). The HD-DN showed higher overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than SD-DN and IDA: the differences between HD-DN and SD-DN (P = 0.009 for OS and P = 0.010 for EFS) were statistically significant. Results of in vitro studies using FLT3-ITD-mutated cell lines supported these findings. In conclusion, HD-DN improved the CR rate, OS, and EFS of FLT3-ITD-mutated AML patients. HD-DN also tended to yield better outcomes than IDA, though the difference was not significant. The superiority of HD-DN over IDA should be confirmed in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)-positive acute myeloid leukaemia have a poor prognosis, including high frequency of relapse, poorer response to salvage therapy, and shorter overall survival than those with FLT3 wild-type disease. We aimed to assess whether single-agent quizartinib, an oral, highly potent and selective type II FLT3 inhibitor, improves overall survival versus salvage chemotherapy. METHODS: QuANTUM-R is a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 152 hospitals and cancer centres in 19 countries. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older with ECOG performance status 0-2 with relapsed or refractory (duration of first composite complete remission ≤6 months) FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia after standard therapy with or without allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted block size of 6; stratified by response to previous therapy and choice of chemotherapy via a phone-based and web-based interactive response system) to quizartinib (60 mg [30 mg lead-in] orally once daily) or investigator's choice of preselected chemotherapy: subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine (subcutaneous injection of cytarabine 20 mg twice daily on days 1-10 of 28-day cycles); intravenous infusions of mitoxantrone (8 mg/m(2) per day), etoposide (100 mg/m(2) per day), and cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-5 of up to two 28-day cycles); or intravenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (300 μg/m(2) per day or 5 μg/kg per day subcutaneously on days 1-5), fludarabine (intravenous infusion 30 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-6), cytarabine (intravenous infusion 2000 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-6), and idarubicin (intravenous infusion 10 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-4 in up to two 28-day cycles). Patients proceeding to haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation after quizartinib could resume quizartinib after haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02039726, and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Sept 13, 2017, 367 patients were enrolled, of whom 245 were randomly allocated to quizartinib and 122 to chemotherapy. Four patients in the quizartinib group and 28 in the chemotherapy group were not treated. Median follow-up was 23·5 months (IQR 15·4-32·3). Overall survival was longer for quizartinib than for chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0·76 [95% CI 0·58-0·98; p=0·02]). Median overall survival was 6·2 months (5·3-7·2) in the quizartinib group and 4·7 months (4·0-5·5) in the chemotherapy group. The most common non-haematological grade 3-5 treatment-emergent adverse events (within ≤30 days of last dose or >30 days if suspected to be a treatment-related event) for quizartinib (241 patients) and chemotherapy (94 patients) were sepsis or septic shock (46 patients [19%] for quizartinib vs 18 [19%] for chemotherapy), pneumonia (29 [12%] vs eight [9%]), and hypokalaemia (28 [12%] vs eight [9%]). The most frequent treatment-related serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (18 patients [7%]), sepsis or septic shock (11 [5%]), QT prolongation (five [2%]), and nausea (five [2%]) in the quizartinib group, and febrile neutropenia (five [5%]), sepsis or septic shock (four [4%]), pneumonia (two [2%]), and pyrexia (two [2%]) in the chemotherapy group. Grade 3 QT prolongation in the quizartinib group was uncommon (eight [3%] by central reading, ten [4%] by investigator report); no grade 4 events occurred. There were 80 (33%) treatment-emergent deaths in the quizartinib group (31 [13%] of which were due to adverse events) and 16 (17%) in the chemotherapy group (nine [10%] of which were due to adverse events). INTERPRETATION: Treatment with quizartinib had a survival benefit versus salvage chemotherapy and had a manageable safety profile in patients with rapidly proliferative disease and very poor prognosis. Quizartinib could be considered a new standard of care. Given that there are only a few available treatment options, this study highlights the value of targeting the FLT3-ITD driver mutation with a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) who harbour a FLT3-ITD mutation have a worse prognosis characterised by increased early relapse. Outcomes following relapse in such patients are typically poor, not only because of earlier relapse, but also because of worse performance post-relapse than those who have the same remission duration but are FLT3-ITD WT. In a single centre retrospective study among relapsed patients, Ravandi et al $1@ found a remission rate of 24% and median survival of only 1 3 weeks. There are therefore twin challenges in this population: first to reduce the early relapse rate, and also to develop more effective treatments post relapse. In the recent QUANTUM-R trial $2@ for patients with relapsed or refractory disease, single agent quizartinib (AC220) was found to significantly improve median survival from 20.4 weeks to 27 weeks when compared to "doctor's choice" treatment (low-dose ara-C, MEC or FLAG-Ida). There is however, no directly comparable data for the population in the QUANTUM-R trial. To contextualise these results, especially given the potentially different outcomes by control treatment, we looked at outcomes in the UK NCRI AML1 5,16,17 trials in patients satisfying the eligibility criteria of QUANTUM-R. Method(s): Patients aged 1 8+ in the UK NCRI AML1 5,16,17 trials were identified who harboured a FLT3 ITD mutation, were treated with intensive chemotherapy, and were either refractory to two courses of induction therapy, or relapsed within six months of transplant, or did not receive a prior transplant and had a remission duration of 6 months or less. Patients were grouped hierarchically as refractory, relapsed post transplant, or relapsed without prior transplant. Eligibility was established at the point a patient first became eligible for analysis. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), measured from point of eligibility, with subsequent remission with or without count recovery as secondary outcome. A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding those who died within 21 days of eligibility to eliminate patients who might be thought of as too unwell to enter a post-relapse trial. Cox regression was used to identify prognostic factors for survival. Result(s): A total of 264 patients were identified (refractory N = 58, relapsed post SCT N = 49, relapsed without SCT N = 1 57). The median age was 51 (range 1 8-84); 2 5% of patients were aged 60 or older; 44% were male, 95% had intermediate cytogenetics; 11% had secondary disease. Split by age, among those under 60 45 were refractory, 44 relapsed post SCT and 11 0 relapsed without SCT; for ages 60+ the figures were 1 3 vs 5 vs 47. Overall 1 7% of patients experienced a subsequent remission; with median survival of 86 days and 1 year OS of 1 3%. If deaths within 21 days were excluded, the remission rate improved to 21%; with a median survival of 1 33 days and 1 year OS of 16%. In multivariable Cox regression, age group HR for age>60 1.81 (1.33-2.47) p=0.0002) and route to eligibility (HR refractory vs relapsed no SCT 0.77 (0.55-1.07); relapsed post SCT vs no SCT 1.58 (1.11-2.25) p=0.003) were the only factors affecting survival-in particular sex, secondary disease, and ITD allelic burden were not significant. In the sensitivity analyses, only age was significant (HR 1.77 (1.24-2.53) p=0.001); with route to eligibility not significant (p=0.1 4). Among patients with post-relapse treatment information, 65% were treated intensively, 8% non-intensively, and 20% with palliation-other received experimental therapies. When restricting attention to those treated intensively, median survival was 1 30 days with 1 7% 1 year OS. F were not materially changed if early death was excluded. Jump to Of 215 patients who had not relapsed post transplant, 53 (25%) received a transplant post-eligibility. In these 56 patients, median survival was 301 days with 42% alive at one year. Conclusion(s): In relapsed/refractory AML, outcomes for FLT3-ITD mutated patients are generally poor and worse for older patients. Applying the eligibility criteria of QUANTUM-R and excluding early deaths gives outcomes comparable to the control group of the QUANTUM-R study. In the 25% of patients who proceeded to transplant survival was extended indicating that a treatment which can deliver patients to transplant has the potential to improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) as a postremission therapy in patients with FLT3-ITD-positive intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains controversial. FLT3-ITD mutations are heterogeneous with respect to allelic ratio, location, and length of the insertion, with a high mutant-to-wild-type ratio consistently associated with inferior prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed the role of alloHCT in first remission in relationship to the allelic ratio and presence or absence of nucleophosmin 1 mutations (NPM1) in the Study Alliance Leukemia AML2003 trial. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 209 patients and concomitant NPM1 mutations in 148 patients. Applying a predefined cutoff ratio of .8, AML was grouped into high- and low-ratio FLT3-ITD AML (HR(FLT3-ITD) and LR(FLT3-ITD)). Sixty-one patients (29%) were transplanted in first remission. Overall survival (OS) (HR, .3; 95% CI, .16 to .7; P = .004) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR, .4; 95% CI, .16 to .9; P = .02) were significantly increased in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML who received alloHCT as consolidation treatment compared with patients who received consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1 who received alloHCT in first remission had increased OS (HR, .3; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P = .02) and EFS (HR, .2; 95% CI, .1 to .8; P = .02), whereas alloHCT in first remission did not have a significant impact on OS and EFS in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and concomitant NPM1 mutation. In conclusion, our results provide additional evidence that alloHCT in first remission improves EFS and OS in patients with HR(FLT3-ITD) AML and in patients with LR(FLT3-ITD) AML and wild-type NPM1.

AB  - Background: According to the recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, the risk level in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 double mutation (AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) ) depends on the allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD. But despite a low or high allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD, AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients belong to the favorable or intermediate risk, for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not obligated. However, some latest studies pointing out that NPM1 and FLT3-ITD double mutation patients showed an inferior prognosis, which have raised concern about the risk categorization and more effective treatment of AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients. Methods: A total of 76 patients were selected for coexisting FLT3 and NPM1 mutations with normal cytogenetics. The prognostic risk factors were analyzed, and treatment strategies including allogeneic stem cell transplantati1on and chemotherapy were compared. Results: In 76 AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients, 36.8% of patients had hyperleukocytosis (HL) and DNMT3A R882 mutation was the most common concomitant gene (23.7%). For 53 patients in the complete remission (CR), 22 had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) on first complete remission (CR1). Patients in transplantation group had better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy only (P=0.002 and 0.001, respectively). In multivariable Cox model analyses, HL and DNMT3A R882 mutation were independent adverse prognostic factors (all P<0.05) for AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients. Nevertheless, allo-HSCT was an independent good factor of OS and DFS (P=0.001 and 0.000; HR =0.173 and 0.138; 95% CI were 0.062-0.483 and 0.049-0.389). And allo-HSCT could moderately improve the poor prognosis of AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+/DNMT3A R882+). Conclusion: Although, AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients are categorized as favorable or intermediate risk levels according to recent NCCN and ELN guidelines, these patients should receive allo-HSCT in CR1 for a longer survival. AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients with DNMT3A R882 mutation had a very poor prognosis, and allo-HSCT could moderately improve their survival.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the efficacy and prognostic factors of induction therapy in FLT3-ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the real world data. Methods: From January 2013 to December 2016, 114 de novo patients with FLT3-ITD(+)AML were enrolled in this study. Out of 114 cases, 75 were male, and 39 were female. The median age was 42 years old (ranged from 14 to 72 years old) . The chemotherapy regimens were used for induction therapy and all cases were followed up. The treatment response was evaluated by MICM and the comparison of the ratio were analyzed by chi-square test and the survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: There were 52 FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis genes (46 cases with NPM1, 5 cases with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 1 case with CEBPA double mutation) and 62 patients with other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML at diagnosis. All patients completed at least one cycle of induction therapy and the clinical curative effect was evaluated, complete remission (CR) rate was 50.0% (57/114) in one cycle and total CR rate was 72.5% (74/104) in two cycles. The CR rate of the FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients with favorable prognosis genes was 67.3% (35/52) in one cycle and 83.3% (40/48) in two cycles; for the other types FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients, the CR rate was 35.5% (22/62) in one cycle and 64.8% (35/54) in two cycles. There was a significant difference in CR rate between the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with and without favorable prognosis genes (P<0.05) . This indicates that the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis gene had relatively good therapeutic effect. Among other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients who did not achieve remission from one cycle of chemotherapy, 9 patients were given sorafenib plus chemotherapy and 6 cases (66.7%) achieved CR; 23 patients were given conventional chemotherapy and 7 cases (30.4%) achieved CR. There was a significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (χ(2)=4.47, P<0.05) and this indicates that sorafenib plus chemotherapy can significantly improve the CR rate of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients. Comparing overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) , there was no significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (P values were 0.641 and 0.517, respectively) . Conclusion: The overall prognosis of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients is poor, and the stratification therapeutic efficacy of FLT3-ITD(+)AML without favorable prognosis gene can be improved by sorafenib combined with chemotherapy.

AB  - The clinical benefit of adding FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3)-directed small molecule therapy to standard first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been established. As part of the UK AML15 and AML17 trials, patients with previously untreated AML and confirmed FLT3-activating mutations, mostly younger than 60 years, were randomly assigned either to receive oral lestaurtinib (CEP701) or not after each of 4 cycles of induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Lestaurtinib was commenced 2 days after completing chemotherapy and administered in cycles of up to 28 days. The trials ran consecutively. Primary endpoints were overall survival in AML15 and relapse-free survival in AML17; outcome data were meta-analyzed. Five hundred patients were randomly assigned between lestaurtinib and control: 74% had FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutations, 23% FLT3-tyrosine kinase domain point mutations, and 2% both types. No significant differences were seen in either 5-year overall survival (lestaurtinib 46% vs control 45%; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI 0.70-1.15; P = .3) or 5-year relapse-free survival (40% vs 36%; hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI 0.69-1.12; P = .3). Exploratory subgroup analysis suggested survival benefit with lestaurtinib in patients receiving concomitant azole antifungal prophylaxis and gemtuzumab ozogamicin with the first course of chemotherapy. Correlative studies included analysis of in vivo FLT3 inhibition by plasma inhibitory activity assay and indicated improved overall survival and significantly reduced rates of relapse in lestaurtinib-treated patients who achieved sustained greater than 85% FLT3 inhibition. In conclusion, combining lestaurtinib with intensive chemotherapy proved feasible in younger patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated AML, but yielded no overall clinical benefit. The improved clinical outcomes seen in patients achieving sustained FLT3 inhibition encourage continued evaluation of FLT3-directed therapy alongside front-line AML treatment. The UK AML15 and AML17 trials are registered at www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN17161961 and www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN55675535 respectively.

AB  - In a randomized trial of therapy for FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) mutant acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse, 224 patients received chemotherapy alone or followed by 80 mg of the FLT3 inhibitor lestaurtinib twice daily. Endpoints included complete remission or complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CR/CRp), overall survival, safety, and tolerability. Correlative studies included pharmacokinetics and analysis of in vivo FLT3 inhibition. There were 29 patients with CR/CRp in the lestaurtinib arm and 23 in the control arm (26% vs 21%; P = .35), and no difference in overall survival between the 2 arms. There was evidence of toxicity in the lestaurtinib-treated patients, particularly those with plasma levels in excess of 20 μM. In the lestaurtinib arm, FLT3 inhibition was highly correlated with remission rate, but target inhibition on day 15 was achieved in only 58% of patients receiving lestaurtinib. Given that such a small proportion of patients on this trial achieved sustained FLT3 inhibition in vivo, any conclusions regarding the efficacy of combining FLT3 inhibition with chemotherapy are limited. Overall, lestaurtinib treatment after chemotherapy did not increase response rates or prolong survival of patients with FLT3 mutant acute myeloid leukemia in first relapse. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00079482.

AB  - The FLT3 gene with internal tandem duplication (ITD) is a poor prognostic factor in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the efficacy of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for AML patients with FLT3-ITD is controversial. We examined 122 AML patients; 34 patients had FLT3-ITD and 39 patients received allogeneic HSCT. The median overall survival (OS) of patients with wtFLT3/nonHSCT, wtFLT3/HSCT, FLT3-ITD/nonHSCT and FLT3-ITD/HSCT was 40.7 months, 53.4 months, 9.8 months and not reached, respectively (p=0.006). Compared to the wtFLT3/nonHSCT patients, the hazard ratio (95% CI) of OS for wtFLT3/HSCT, FLT3-ITD/nonHSCT and FLT3-ITD/HSCT was 1.39 (0.61-3.18), 3.57 (1.58-8.10) and 0.40 (0.11-1.59), respectively, after adjustment of age, sex, WBC, LDH, karyotype, NPM, and FAB classification. This result indicated that patients with FLT3-ITD/nonHSCT had a significantly worse outcome, but allogeneic HSCT improved the prognosis for patients with FLT3-ITD.

AB  - Introduction: Allogeneic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) provides pts with FLT3-ITD+ AML the highest likelihood of sustained remission, but relapse rates remain high. Post-SCT maintenance therapy may improve this outcome. Objective(s): RADIUS, a randomized, open-label, phase 2 exploratory trial (NCT01883362) investigated whether SOC +/- mido after alloSCT reduced relapse rates in pts with FLT3-ITD+ AML. Method(s): Eligible adults (aged 18-70 y) who had undergone myeloablative alloSCT in first complete remission (hematologic recovery and transfusion independence) were enrolled after engraftment and randomized 28 to 60 days after alloSCT to receive SOC +/- mido 50 mg twice daily for up to 12 (4-week) cycles. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS) at 18 mo after alloSCT; safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), in vivo FLT3 inhibition by FLT3 plasma inhibitory activity (PIA) assay, overall survival (OS), and RFS at 24 mo after alloSCT were also assessed. The study was not adequately powered to detect a statistical difference between arms; a sample size of 60 was calculated to detect a 50% reduction in the risk of relapse with 71% power if the incidence of relapse in the SOC + mido arm was 15%. Result(s): 60 pts were randomized (30 per arm); 30 completed 12 cycles of therapy (14 with SOC; 16 with SOC + mido). The median dose intensity was 93 mg/day (range, 15-100 mg/day). Early discontinuations were similar between arms (15 with SOC; 13 with SOC + mido), often due to adverse events (AEs; 3% vs 27%) and consent withdrawal (20% vs 7%). 19 pts (63%) had mido dose modifications (84% due to AEs; concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor, n = 1). With SOC alone, the estimated RFS (95% CI) at 18 mo was 76% (54%-88%) vs 89% (69%-96%) with SOC + mido (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.12-1.86]; P =.27); the predicted relative reduction in the risk of relapse with the addition of mido was 54%. At 24 mo, OS (95% CI) was 85% with addition of mido (65%-94%) vs 76% with SOC alone (54%-89%) (P =.3418). PIA was evaluable in 28 pts in each arm; PK was evaluated in the SOC + mido arm. There was wide interpatient variability in trough levels of mido and its active metabolites ([CGP62221] + [CGP52421/5.4]) and in the degree of FLT3 inhibition. With mido, phosphorylated FLT3 (pFLT3) levels were <70% of baseline in 14 pts (median, 70%) and were associated with a benefit in RFS and OS (P =.0048) (Figures 1 and 2). Mean drug levels generally correlated with mean suppression of pFLT3 (Figure 3). With SOC and SOC + mido, AEs occurred in 87% and 100% of pts; serious AEs occurred in 57% and 30% of pts, respectively. 12 pts died on study (during follow-up phase; 8 with SOC and 4 with SOC + mido [n = 4 vs n = 2 due to AML disease progression]). Conclusion(s): Mido as maintenance therapy was safely added for <= 1 y after alloSCT and, when added to SOC, reduced the predicted risk of relapse at 18 mo after alloSCT by 54% (vs SOC). Correlative analysis suggests that high levels of pFLT3 inhibition may positively influence outcomes. Copyright © 2018

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Midostaurin, a multikinase and FLT3 inhibitor, is the first non-chemotherapy agent approved and widely adopted for the treatment of FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Yet, its role in improving survival of patients referred to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in first complete remission (CR1) needs to be defined. METHODS: This multicenter study retrospectively evaluated the outcome of 119 FLT3-ITD AML patients [59 (49.6%) males and 60 females] intensively treated between 2015 and 2019 at five Israeli centers. In our cohort, allo-SCT in CR1 was widely implemented (47%) and patient stratification was based on the current allelic ratio (AR) cutoff of 0.5. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (82.3%) achieved CR1/CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi). Death during induction was reported in 7 (5.9%) patients. In multivariate analysis, midostaurin use and allo-SCT in CR1 were the most significant factors affecting overall survival (OS). Midostaurin incorporation in chemotherapy regimens significantly improved CR + CRi rates (P = .002), reduced relapse rates (P = .02), and was remarkably advantageous for high-AR patients (2-year OS 82%). In low-AR patients, the midostaurin effect was much less prominent. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate benefits of midostaurin incorporation in intensive chemotherapy regimens, particularly for high-AR AML patients to whom it should be offered along with allo-SCT in CR1.

AB  - The adverse prognosis of internal tandem duplication in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene(s) (FLT3-ITD) in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) may depend on allelic burden. We compared postremission treatment with chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 169 FLT3-ITDmut intermediate cytogenetic risk AML patients with allelic ratio evaluable at diagnosis who achieved first complete remission (CR1) with induction therapy. To minimize selection bias, the analysis was limited to patients who remained in CR1 for at least 4 months (median time to HSCT) after achieving CR1, and propensity score matching was implemented. Sensitivity analysis including patients who remained in CR1 for at least 3 months was applied as well. HSCT in CR1 was associated with longer relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), with 3-year estimated rates of 18% and 24%, respectively (P < .001), for patients receiving chemotherapy and 46% and 54%, respectively (P < .001), for those undergoing HSCT. Multivariate regression models showed that HSCT remained statistically significant with improved RFS and OS independent of FLT3-ITD allelic ratio and NPM1 status. Irrespective of postremission therapy, relapse remains the main reason for treatment failure, with a 3-year incidence of 68% in chemotherapy recipients versus 41% in HSCT recipients. Allogeneic HSCT improved disease outcomes compared with chemotherapy after propensity score matching was applied. The improvement observed for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.55; P = .09) and OS (HR, 0.58; P = .10) with HSCT as postremission therapy in patients who remained in CR1 for at least 4 months did not reach statistical significance; however, the sensitivity analyses including patients who remained in CR1 for at least 3 months showed significant improvement in both RFS (HR, 0.31; P = .002) and OS (HR, 0.27; P = .02) after propensity score matching. Our results indicate that HSCT in CR1 for AML FLT3-ITDmut patients is associated with longer RFS and OS. Innovative transplantation strategies to improve relapse incidence are urgently needed.

AB  - Background: R/R FLT3-ITD AML patients still represent an unmet clinical need. Aim(s): To assess outcome, safety and duration of hospitalizations in two retrospective groups of patients treated with TKIs or chemotherapy, respectively. Method(s): We collected data of 58 consecutive FLT3-ITD AML patients treated at our Institution from 2004 to 2017. Patients received chemotherapy (3+7 like regimens; 3+7 like regimens with the addition of a third agent; fludarabine based regimens) and/or single agent TKIs (Sorafenib, Ponatinib, Quizartinib, Gilteritinib, Midostaurin). Result(s): We compared patients who received at least once in their life, as salvage treatment, a TKI inhibitor ("TKI" group; N=36) with patients who were treated with conventional cytotoxic ("conventional group"; N=22). There were no differences in patients age, WBC count, platelet count and ELN risk between the two groups. Fifty-one out of 58 patients (86%) relapsed after (N=22; 36%) or were refractory (N=29; 50%) to the first course of chemotherapy. Second-line therapy included salvage chemotherapy (N=32/51, 63%), a TKI (N=12/51, 23%) or best supportive therapy (N=14%, 7/51); 24 patients received a TKI in 3rd or further relapse. Standard chemotherapy compared with TKIs did not show an increased CR rate (25% vs 16.7%), and it was not a better bridge-to-transplant option (56.2% vs 43.7%). However, among R/R patients, we observed a better OS for "TKI" patients compared with "conventional" ones (median OS of 10 months [95% CI, 5.89-14.12] and 4 months [95% CI, 3.12- 4.90], respectively; p=.017). Patients in "TKI" group experienced a lower number of AEs during treatment with TKIs (1.63 mean AEs in each TKI line vs 3.03 mean AEs in each chemotherapy line, p<.001). AEs during TKI therapy were less severe than AEs during chemotherapy (p=.049). We also noted a trend toward less day spent in hospital per month by patients during TKI treatment: 10.5 days and 16.7 days in the two groups, respectively. Conclusion(s): We observed a survival advantage of TKI in R/R FLT3 ITD AML patients, due to the lower number and grade of AEs. For their safety profile, TKIs are probably a better option to bridge patients to transplant, thanks to a lower risk of toxicity. Keywords: TKI, AML Copyright © 2018

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3) infrequently have a response to salvage chemotherapy. Gilteritinib is an oral, potent, selective FLT3 inhibitor with single-agent activity in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. METHODS: In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy. The two primary end points were overall survival and the percentage of patients who had complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery. Secondary end points included event-free survival (freedom from treatment failure [i.e., relapse or lack of remission] or death) and the percentage of patients who had complete remission. RESULTS: Of 371 eligible patients, 247 were randomly assigned to the gilteritinib group and 124 to the salvage chemotherapy group. The median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than that in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). The median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The percentage of patients who had complete remission with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). In an analysis that was adjusted for therapy duration, adverse events of grade 3 or higher and serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the gilteritinib group than in the chemotherapy group; the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher in the gilteritinib group were febrile neutropenia (45.9%), anemia (40.7%), and thrombocytopenia (22.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Gilteritinib resulted in significantly longer survival and higher percentages of patients with remission than salvage chemotherapy among patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Two distinct forms of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations, internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutation within the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), have been identified in considerable number of patients with AML. This study was aimed to analyze the impacts of these mutations on clinical outcomes, and assess the efficacy of different therapeutic regimens (allo-HSCT, sorafenib, or conventional chemotherapy) for AML patients with FLT3 mutations after the standard induction therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed DNA samples from 158 consecutive de novo AML patients (18-60 years, excluding APL) with FLT3 mutations between July 2010 and October 2015. RESULTS: We found that AML patients with FLT3-TKD mutations have more favorable clinical outcomes than those with FLT3-ITD mutations. We also found that allo-HSCT therapy subgroup achieved longer OS and RFS than non-allo-HSCT therapy subgroup for FLT3-ITD positive patients (p < 0.001, p = 0.071). However, compared with the clinical outcomes in non-primary refractory patients, sorafenib did not show an obvious beneficial effect for the primary refractory patients. Further study on a large scale is still recommended. CONCLUSIONS: FLT3-TKD-mutated AML patients have more favorable clinical outcomes than those with FLT3-ITD mutations. Allo-HSCT therapy subgroup achieved longer OS and RFS than non-allo-HSCT therapy subgroup for FLT3-ITD positive patients. Compared with the clinical outcomes in non-primary refractory patients, sorafenib did not show an obvious beneficial effect for the primary refractory patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical data and results from non-randomised trials suggest that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib might be an effective drug for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib versus placebo in addition to standard chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was done at 25 sites in Germany. We enrolled patients aged 18-60 years with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myeloid leukaemia who had a WHO clinical performance score 0-2, adequate renal and liver function, no cardiac comorbidities, and no recent trauma or operation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive two cycles of induction therapy with daunorubicin (60 mg/m(2) on days 3-5) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) on days 1-7), followed by three cycles of high-dose cytarabine consolidation therapy (3 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1, 3, and 5) plus either sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo on days 10-19 of induction cycles 1 and 2, from day 8 of each consolidation, and as maintenance for 12 months. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation was scheduled for all intermediate-risk patients with a sibling donor and for all high-risk patients with a matched donor in first remission. Computer-generated randomisation was done in blocks. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, with an event defined as either primary treatment failure or relapse or death, assessed in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. We report the final analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00893373, and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2008-004968-40). FINDINGS: Between March 27, 2009, and Nov 28, 2011, 276 patients were enrolled and randomised, of whom nine did not receive study medication. 267 patients were included in the primary analysis (placebo, n=133; sorafenib, n=134). With a median follow-up of 36 months (IQR 35·5-38·1), median event-free survival was 9 months (95% CI 4-15) in the placebo group versus 21 months (9-32) in the sorafenib group, corresponding to a 3-year event-free survival of 22% (95% CI 13-32) in the placebo group versus 40% (29-51) in the sorafenib group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·64, 95% CI; 0·45-0·91; p=0·013). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were fever (71 [53%] in the placebo group vs 73 [54%] in the sorafenib group), infections (55 [41%] vs 46 [34%]), pneumonia (21 [16%] vs 20 [14%]), and pain (13 [10%] vs 15 [11%]). Grade 3 or worse adverse events that were significantly more common in the sorafenib group than the placebo group were fever (relative risk [RR] 1·54, 95% CI 1·04-2·28), diarrhoea (RR 7·89, 2·94-25·2), bleeding (RR 3·75, 1·5-10·0), cardiac events (RR 3·46, 1·15-11·8), hand-foot-skin reaction (only in sorafenib group), and rash (RR 4·06, 1·25-15·7). INTERPRETATION: In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia aged 60 years or younger, the addition of sorafenib to standard chemotherapy has antileukaemic efficacy but also increased toxicity. Our findings suggest that kinase inhibitors could be a useful addition to curative treatment for acute myeloid leukaemia. Overall survival after long-term follow-up and strategies to reduce toxicity are needed to determine the future role of sorafenib in treatment of this disease. FUNDING: Bayer HealthCare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The addition of midostaurin to induction chemotherapy improves survival in younger patients with newly diagnosed, FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Sorafenib is a potent multikinase inhibitor with efficacy when given as monotherapy. The authors investigated whether the addition of sorafenib to intensive induction chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-mutated AML. METHODS: In total, 183 patients who were newly diagnosed with FLT3-ITD-mutated AML between February 2001 and December 2017 were identified. Of these, 79 patients (43%) underwent intensive chemotherapy with the addition of sorafenib, and 104 (57%) received intensive chemotherapy alone. Propensity score matching identified 42 patients in each cohort. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 98% in the sorafenib cohort and 83% in the intensive chemotherapy cohort (P = .057). The median follow-up was 54 months. The median event-free survival was 35 months in the sorafenib cohort and 8 months in the intensive chemotherapy cohort (P = .019), and the median overall survival was 42 and 13 months, respectively (P = .026). With censoring at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the median event-free survival was 31 and 8 months in the sorafenib and intensive therapy cohorts, respectively (P = .031), and the median overall survival was not reached and 10 months, respectively (P = .001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models confirmed that treatment with sorafenib was a favorable prognostic factor (P = .009; hazard ratio, 0.558; 95% CI, 0.360-0.865). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sorafenib improves survival in patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated AML regardless of whether they undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive impact of allelic ratio and insertion site (IS) of internal tandem duplications (ITDs), as well as concurrent gene mutations, with regard to postremission therapy in 323 patients with FLT3-ITD-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Increasing FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (P = .004) and IS in the tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TKD1, P = .06) were associated with low complete remission (CR) rates. After postremission therapy including intensive chemotherapy (n = 121) or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, n = 17), an allelic ratio ≥ 0.51 was associated with an unfavorable relapse-free (RFS, P = .0008) and overall survival (OS, P = .004); after allogeneic HSCT (n = 93), outcome was significantly improved in patients with a high allelic ratio (RFS, P = .02; OS, P = .03), whereas no benefit was seen in patients with a low allelic ratio (RFS, P = .38; OS, P = .64). Multivariable analyses revealed a high allelic ratio as a predictive factor for the beneficial effect of allogeneic HSCT; ITD IS in TKD1 remained an unfavorable factor, whereas no prognostic impact of concurrent gene mutations was observed. The clinical trials described herein were previously published or are registered as follows: AMLHD93 and AMLHD98A, previously published; AML SG 07-04, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier #NCT00151242.

AB  - Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) have poor outcomes to current treatment. A phase 2 hypothesis-generating trial was conducted to determine whether the addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to intensive chemotherapy followed by allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) and single-agent maintenance therapy of 12 months is feasible and favorably influences event-free survival (EFS) compared with historical controls. Patients 18 to 70 years of age with newly diagnosed AML and centrally confirmed FLT3-ITD were eligible: 284 patients were treated, including 198 younger (18-60 years) and 86 older (61-70 years) patients. Complete remission (CR) rate, including CR with incomplete hematological recovery (CRi) after induction therapy, was 76.4% (younger, 75.8%; older, 77.9%). The majority of patients in CR/CRi proceeded to alloHCT (72.4%). Maintenance therapy was started in 97 patients (34%): 75 after alloHCT and 22 after consolidation with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC). Median time receiving maintenance therapy was 9 months after alloHCT and 10.5 months after HiDAC; premature termination was mainly a result of nonrelapse causes (gastrointestinal toxicity and infections). EFS and overall survival at 2 years were 39% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33%-47%) and 34% (95% CI, 24%-47%) and 53% (95% CI, 46%-61%) and 46% (95% CI, 35%-59%) in younger and older patients, respectively. EFS was evaluated in comparison with 415 historical controls treated within 5 prospective trials. Propensity score-weighted analysis revealed a significant improvement of EFS by midostaurin (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48-0.70; P < .001) overall and in older patients (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.29-0.61). The study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01477606.

AB  - PURPOSE: The prognosis of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still dismal even with intensive chemotherapy. In this trial, we compared the antileukemic activity of standard induction and consolidation therapy with or without the addition of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib in elderly patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients received standard cytarabine and daunorubicin induction (7+3 regimen) and up to two cycles of intermediate-dose cytarabine consolidation. Two hundred one patients were equally randomly assigned to receive either sorafenib or placebo between the chemotherapy cycles and subsequently for up to 1 year after the beginning of therapy. The primary objective was to test for an improvement in event-free survival (EFS). Overall survival (OS), complete remission (CR) rate, tolerability, and several predefined subgroup analyses were among the secondary objectives. RESULTS: Age, sex, CR and early death (ED) probability, and prognostic factors were balanced between both study arms. Treatment in the sorafenib arm did not result in significant improvement in EFS or OS. This was also true for subgroup analyses, including the subgroup positive for FLT3 internal tandem duplications. Results of induction therapy were worse in the sorafenib arm, with higher treatment-related mortality and lower CR rates. More adverse effects occurred during induction therapy in the sorafenib arm, and patients in this arm received less consolidation chemotherapy as a result of higher induction toxicity. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, combination of standard induction and consolidation therapy with sorafenib in the schedule investigated in our trial is not beneficial for elderly patients with AML.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a FLT3 mutation have poor outcomes. We conducted a phase 3 trial to determine whether the addition of midostaurin - an oral multitargeted kinase inhibitor that is active in patients with a FLT3 mutation - to standard chemotherapy would prolong overall survival in this population. METHODS: We screened 3277 patients, 18 to 59 years of age, who had newly diagnosed AML for FLT3 mutations. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard chemotherapy (induction therapy with daunorubicin and cytarabine and consolidation therapy with high-dose cytarabine) plus either midostaurin or placebo; those who were in remission after consolidation therapy entered a maintenance phase in which they received either midostaurin or placebo. Randomization was stratified according to subtype of FLT3 mutation: point mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) or internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation with either a high ratio (>0.7) or a low ratio (0.05 to 0.7) of mutant to wild-type alleles (ITD [high] and ITD [low], respectively). Allogeneic transplantation was allowed. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients underwent randomization; 360 were assigned to the midostaurin group, and 357 to the placebo group. The FLT3 subtype was ITD (high) in 214 patients, ITD (low) in 341 patients, and TKD in 162 patients. The treatment groups were well balanced with respect to age, race, FLT3 subtype, cytogenetic risk, and blood counts but not with respect to sex (51.7% in the midostaurin group vs. 59.4% in the placebo group were women, P=0.04). Overall survival was significantly longer in the midostaurin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.009), as was event-free survival (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.78; one-sided P=0.002). In both the primary analysis and an analysis in which data for patients who underwent transplantation were censored, the benefit of midostaurin was consistent across all FLT3 subtypes. The rate of severe adverse events was similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of the multitargeted kinase inhibitor midostaurin to standard chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall and event-free survival among patients with AML and a FLT3 mutation.

AB  - To determine the long-term efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) in the salvage setting for relapsed and refractory (rel/ref) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (AML FLT3-ITD), we conducted a retrospective study of 120 patients with rel/ref AML FLT3-ITD who received salvage therapy with either FLT3i-containing regimen (FLT3i group, N = 45) or conventional cytotoxic regimen (conventional group, N = 75). The median overall survival (OS) after the first salvage in the FLT3i group was 6·9 vs. 4·6 months in the conventional group (P = 0·17). The OS was better in the FLT3i group among patients with initial complete remission (CR) duration ≤12 months or with primary refractory disease (6·9 vs. 3·7 months; P < 0·01). The OS was better when FLT3i was combined with cytotoxic agents versus monotherapy (17 vs. 4·8 months; P = 0·017). Multivariate analysis revealed that the use of FLT3i was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio 0·58; 95% confidence interval, 0·38-0·88). Incorporating FLT3i into salvage strategies may improve long-term outcome of patients with AML FLT3-ITD. Prospective studies to validate this conclusion are warranted.

AB  - Cytogenetic and genetic changes have prognostic significance in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In our study, we compared the cytogenetic changes and gene mutations (NPM1, CEBPA, DNMT3A, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and C-KIT) with clinical outcomes in 1132 patients with AML enrolled at our center over a 10-year period. A total of 977 patients provided gene mutation data. There were subsets of patients who exhibited mutations in NPM1 (17.9%), CEBPA (16.4%), FLT3-ITD (18.5%), FLT3-TKD (3.9%), DNMT3A (8.6%), and C-KIT (8.8%). A total of 557 patients (49.2%) underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as consolidation therapy. Multivariate analysis identified an adverse karyotype (hazard ratio [HR], 1.48; P = .001), the presence of FLT3-ITD (HR, 1.90; P < .001), and receipt of nonstandard first-line induction chemotherapy (HR, 1.45; P = .003) as significant risk factors for poor overall survival (OS), and the presence of CEBPA(mut) (HR, .42; P < .001) and receipt of HSCT (HR, .35; P < .001) as prognostic factors for favorable OS. In addition, the presence of FLT3-ITD(mut) (HR, 2.11; P < .001) was identified as an independent risk factor for poor disease-free survival (DFS), and receipt of HSCT was correlated with improved DFS (HR, .74; P = .046). Compared with chemotherapy as consolidation therapy, HSCT improved the prognosis and overcame the prognostic effect of karyotype from the initial diagnosis; however, the presence of FLT3-ITD or CEBPA mutation can predict prognosis in AML irrespective of HSCT.

AB  - The optimal therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) who relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. In this study we retrospectively evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib combined with other therapeutic strategies as salvage therapy for these patients. Eighty-three AML patients with FLT3-ITD relapsing after allo-HSCT were enrolled in this study. Fifty-three patients received salvage therapy containing sorafenib and 30 patients did not. Salvage therapy containing sorafenib was superior to that without sorafenib with respect to complete remission rates, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS) (66.0% versus 30.0%, 46.8% versus 20.0%, and 44.9% versus 16.7%, respectively; P = .002, P = .003, and P = .001). Further subgroup analysis revealed that the OS and PFS of patients who received sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) were superior to those receiving other therapeutic regimens, including sorafenib combined with chemotherapy, chemotherapy followed by DLI, and monochemotherapy (P = .003, P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that salvage therapy including sorafenib was the only protective factor for longer OS (P = .035; hazard ratio [HR], .526); salvage therapy including sorafenib and DLI were the protective factors for longer PFS (P = .011, HR, .423; P = .019, HR, .508). Our data suggest that sorafenib therapy is associated with improved outcomes for FLT3-ITD AML relapsing after allo-HSCT, and whether sorafenib combined with chemotherapy followed by DLI reveals an optimal efficacy merits further study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Findings of retrospective studies suggest that sorafenib maintenance post-transplantation might reduce relapse in patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We investigated the efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib maintenance post-transplantation in this population. METHODS: We did an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial at seven hospitals in China. Eligible patients (aged 18-60 years) had FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia, were undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, had composite complete remission before and after transplantation, and had haematopoietic recovery within 60 days post-transplantation. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to sorafenib maintenance (400 mg orally twice daily) or non-maintenance (control) at 30-60 days post-transplantation. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks (block size four) and implemented through an interactive web-based randomisation system. The primary endpoint was the 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02474290; the trial is complete. FINDINGS: Between June 20, 2015, and July 21, 2018, 202 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to sorafenib maintenance (n=100) or control (n=102). Median follow-up post-transplantation was 21·3 months (IQR 15·0-37·0). The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 7·0% (95% CI 3·1-13·1) in the sorafenib group and 24·5% (16·6-33·2) in the control group (hazard ratio 0·25, 95% CI 0·11-0·57; p=0·0010). Within 210 days post-transplantation, the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were infections (25 [25%] of 100 patients in the sorafenib group vs 24 [24%] of 102 in the control group), acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD; 23 [23%] of 100 vs 21 [21%] of 102), chronic GVHD (18 [18%] of 99 vs 17 [17%] of 99), and haematological toxicity (15 [15%] of 100 vs seven [7%] of 102). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Sorafenib maintenance post-transplantation can reduce relapse and is well tolerated in patients with FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. This strategy could be a suitable therapeutic option for patients with FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia. FUNDING: None.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of sorafenib on the outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-internal tandem duplication (ITD) undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). METHODS: A total of 144 patients with FLT3-ITD AML undergoing allo-HSCT between January 2012 and December 2015 were enrolled in this study. Depending on whether they were receiving sorafenib before transplantation or sorafenib maintenance after transplantation, patients were divided into 4 groups: patients receiving sorafenib before transplantation (group A; n = 36), patients receiving sorafenib after transplantation (group B; n = 32), patients receiving sorafenib both before and after transplantation (group C; n = 26), and patients receiving sorafenib neither before nor after transplantation (group D; n = 50). Outcomes were compared among these groups. RESULTS: The 3-year relapse rates were 22.2%, 18.8%, 15.8%, and 46.1% for groups A, B, C, and D, respectively (P = .006). The 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 74.9%, 78.1%, 84.6%, and 50.9%, respectively (P = .023), and the 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) rates were 69.4%, 78.1%, 80.4%, and 34.8%, respectively (P < .001). The relapse rate was higher and the LFS was shorter in group D versus groups A, B, and C. The OS in group D was shorter than the OS in group C but was similar to the OS in groups A and B. A multivariate analysis revealed that sorafenib before transplantation, sorafenib maintenance after transplantation, and their combined application were protective factors for a lower relapse rate (hazard ratios [HRs], 0.436 [P = .048], 0.431 [P = .046], and 0.173 [P = .002], respectively) and longer LFS (HRs, 0.322 [P = .010], 0.343 [P = .014], and 0.187 [P = .001], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib before transplantation, sorafenib maintenance after transplantation, and their combined application all could improve the outcomes for patients with FLT3-ITD AML. Further study is needed to determine whether the use of sorafenib both before and after transplantation might be ideal. Cancer 2018;124:1954-63. © 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical features of acute myeloid leukemia patients with Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation and the therapeutic effect of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy as first-line therapy for these patients. Methods: Clinical features and therapeutic effect were retrospectively analyzed in 53 AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation diagnosed in Henan Cancer Hospital from January 2013 to August 2016. The biological characteristics and clinical efficacy of chemotherapy in combination with or without Sorafeinb were analyzed. Results: FLT3-ITD mutation was identified in 53 AML patients, 22 cases (41.5%) were M(5) subtype. The median of the peripheral WBC was 61.00 (0.98-920.00) ×10(9)/L, and there were 50 (94.3%) patients with WBC>10×10(9)/L. The median of blast cell in bone marrow was 0.730 (0.234-0.966) . The total remission rate of all these 53 patients was 56.6% (30/53) . The complete remission (CR) rates in patients treated with chemotherapy in combination with sorafenib and patients with chemotherapy alone were 86.4% (19/22) and 35.5% (11/31) , respectively. The 1-year overall survival rates of the two groups were 78.3%% and 50.0% (P=0.041) , and 1-year progression free survival rates were 75.9% and 42.4% (P=0.044) , respectively. Conclusion: AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation have the characteristics of high peripheral WBC, high blast cells in bone marrow and accompanying with M(5) subtype. Sorafeinb combined with chemotherapy can significantly improve CR rate and short term survival.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics and prognosis of 34 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) and MLL gene rearrangement. Methods: The clinical data of 34 AML patients with FLT3-ITD and MLL gene rearrangement was compared and analyzed for the therapeutic efficacy, prognostic factors when treated with chemotherapy, chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Results: Of the thirty-four cases with median age 41 (4-71) years old, 63.6% presented with white blood cells (WBC) greater than 30×10(9)/L, 39.4% greater than 50 × 10(9)/L respectively on admission. M(5) (35.3%) made up the highest proportion. The cytogenetic abnormality reached 61.8%, of which the complex cytogenetic abnormality accounted for 11.8%. Eleven patients (32.35%) had both FLT3-ITD and MLL gene abnormalities. In addition to FLT3 and MLL abnormalities, 23 patients (67.6%) had one or more other gene abnormalities (multiple gene abnormalities). Of the 34 cases, 29.4% patients went into complete remission (CR) after two courses of chemotherapy. 20.6% (7 patients) went into CR after 3 or more courses of chemotherapy. The rate of early relapse in the CR group was 52.9%. Patients with WBC>50×10(9)/L or multiple gene abnormalities had a lower remission rate (7.7%, 5.4%) after two courses of chemotherapy. CR rate for the patients with more than three gene abnormalities was 0. The total 2-year overall survival (OS) in the 34 patients was 28.8% (95% CI 13.5%-46.0%) and the disease-free survival (DFS) was 27.1% (95% CI 12.5%-44.0%). Of the 18 patients treated with chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, 17 cases died within 2 years and 1 lost follow-up after giving up treatment. For the 16 patients received allo-HSCT, the 3-year OS was 43.4% (95% CI 13.7%-70.4%) and DFS 42.7% (95% CI 13.4%-69.7%). Conclusion: AML patients with FLT3-ITD and MLL gene rearrangement often presented with M(5), accompanied by hyperleukocytosis, cytogenetic or multiple gene abnormalities. Those patients were observed to have low response rate and high early relapse when treated with chemotherapy without allo-HSCT. Patients had multiple gene abnormalities may be an important poor prognostic factor. Allo-HSCT is an effective treatment which could significantly improve the prognosis and survival of AML patients with FLT3-ITD and MLL gene abnormalities.
